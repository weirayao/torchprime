A bar of\\nsunlight streamed in at the window, in which dust-motes were dancing by\\nthe thousand. A man and woman were lying in bed; I was standing up in my\\ncot, plucking at the woman with my podgy fingers. She stirred, turned,\\nrubbed her eyes, smiled, stretched out her arms, and drew me under the\\nbed-clothes beside her. The man slept on.\\n\\nThis is my earliest recollection. If it be true that the soul is born\\nnot at the same time as the body, but at a later period with the first\\nglimmering of memory, then this was the morning on which my soul groped\\nits way into the world.\\n\\nI have sometimes thought that I have never grown wiser than the\\nknowledge contained in that first recollection. Nothing that I have to\\nrecord in this book will carry me much further. The scene is symbolic:\\na little child, inarticulate, early awakened in a sunlit room, vainly\\nstriving to make life answer questions. Do we ever get beyond that? The\\nwoman is Nature. The man is God. The room is the world--for me it has\\nalways been filled with sunlight.\\n\\nMy mother I remember as very tall and patient, vaguely beautiful and\\nsmiling. I can recall hardly anything she said--only her atmosphere and\\nthe fragrance of violets which seemed always to cling about her. I know\\nthat she took me out beneath the stars one night; there was frost on the\\nground and church-bells were ringing. And I know that one summer’s\\nday, on a holiday at Ransby, she led me through lanes far out into the\\ncountry till my legs were very tired. We came to a large white house,\\nstanding in a parkland. There we hid behind a clump of trees for hours.\\nA horseman came riding down the avenue. My mother ran out from behind\\nthe trees and tried to make him speak with her. She held me up to show\\nme to him, and grasped his rein to make him halt. He said something\\nangrily, set spurs to his horse, and disappeared at a gallop. She began\\nto cry, telling me that the man was her father. I was too tired to pay\\nmuch attention. She had to carry me most of the way home. It was dark\\nwhen we entered Ransby.\\n\\nIn London some months later--it must have been wintertime, for we were\\nsitting by the fire-light--she took me in her arms and asked me if I\\nwould like to have a sister. I refused stoutly. At dawn I was wakened\\nby hurrying feet on the staircase. Next day I was given a new box of\\nsoldiers to keep me quiet. A lot of strange people stole in and out the\\nhouse as if they owned it. I never saw my mother again.\\n\\nAll I had known of her had been so shy and gentle that it was a good\\ndeal of a surprise to me to learn years later that, as a girl, she had\\nbeen considered rather dashing. She had been called “The gay Miss Fannie\\nEvrard” and her marriage with my father had begun with an elopement. Her\\nfather was Sir Charles Evrard, brother-in-law to the Earl of Lovegrove;\\nmy father’s folk were ship-chandlers in Ransby, outfitting vessels for\\nthe Baltic trade.\\n\\nThe inequality of the match, as far as social position was concerned,\\nmade life in Ransby impossible. My father was only a reporter on the\\nlocal paper at the time of his escapade; the Evrards lived at Woadley\\nHall and were reckoned among the big people in the county. It must have\\nbeen to this house that my mother took me on that dusty summer’s day.\\n\\nAfter his marriage my father settled down in London, gaining his living\\nas a free-lance journalist. I believe he was very poor at the start. He\\ndid not re-visit Ransby until years later. Pride prevented. My mother\\nreturned as often as finances would allow, in the vain hope of a\\nreconciliation with her family. On these occasions she would stay at the\\nship-chandler’s, and was an object of curiosity and commiseration among\\nthe neighbors.\\n\\nMost of the facts which lie outside my own recollection were\\ncommunicated to me by my grandmother. She never got over her amazement\\nat her son’s audacity. It was without parallel in her experience until\\nI attempted to repeat his performance with an entirely individual\\nvariation. She never tired of rehearsing the details; it was noticeable\\nthat she always referred to my mother as “Miss Fannie.”\\n\\n“Often and often,” she would say, “have I seen Miss Fannie come\\na-prancin’ down the High Street with her groom a-followin’. She was\\nalways mounted on a gray horse, with a touch of red about her. Sometimes\\nit was a red feather in her hat and sometimes a scarlet cloak. When Sir\\nCharles rode beside her you could see the pride in his eye. She was his\\nonly child.”\\n\\nAfter my small sister failed to arrive someone must have told me that\\nmy mother had gone to find her. I would sit for hours at the window,\\nwatching for her homecoming.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II--THE MAGIC CARPET\\n\\nI was born in South London on a crowded street lying off the Old\\nKent Road. It was here that my mother died. When I was about six, a\\nfalse-dawn came in my father’s prospects, on the promise of which he\\nmoved northward to the suburb of Stoke Newington.\\n\\nAt the time of which I write, Stoke Newington still retained a village\\natmosphere. The houses, for the most part, were old, bow-windowed,\\nand quaint. Many of them were occupied by leisured people--retired\\ncity-merchants, maiden-ladies, and widows, who came there because it\\nwas reasonable in price without being shabby. It was a backwater of the\\nsurging stream of London life where one found time to grow flowers, read\\nbooks, and be kindly. Its red, tree-shaded streets witnessed many an\\nold-fashioned love-affair. The early morning was filled with country\\nsounds--singing of birds, creaking of wooden-gates, and cock-crowing.\\n\\nOur house was situated in Pope Lane, a blind alley overgrown with limes.\\nIt had posts set up at the entrance to prevent wheel-traffic. You could\\nnot see the houses from the lane, so steeply did the walls rise up on\\neither side. It led nowhere and was a mere tunnel dotted with doors.\\nDid the doors open by chance as you were passing, you caught glimpses\\nof kitchen-gardens, shrubberies, and well-kept lawns. We rarely saw our\\nneighbors. Each door hid a mystery, on which a child could exercise his\\nfancy.\\n\\nMy father was too strenuously engaged in wringing an income out of\\nreluctant editors to pay much attention to my upbringing. In moving to\\nPope Lane, he had made an increase in his expenditure which, as events\\nproved, his prospects did not warrant. The keeping up of appearances was\\na continuous and unrelenting fight. Early in the morning he was at his\\ndesk; the last thing in the evening, when I ventured into his study to\\nbid him good-night, his pen was still toiling industriously across\\nthe page. His mornings were spent in hack-work, preparing special\\narticles on contemporary economics for a group of daily papers. His\\nevenings were given over to the writing of books which he hoped would\\nbring him fame, many of which are still unpublished.\\n\\nHe coveted fame and despised it. He wrote to please himself and\\nexpected praise. He was an unpractical idealist, always planning huge\\nundertakings for which there was no market. His most important work,\\nwhich occupied twenty years of his life, was _The History of Human\\nProgress_. It was really a history of human selfishness, written\\nto prove that every act which has dug man out of the mire, however\\nseemingly sacrificial and noble, had for its initial motive an\\nenlightened self-interest. He never managed to get it before the public.\\nIt was disillusionizing. We all know that we are selfish, but we all\\nhope that with luck we could be heroes.\\n\\nThe trouble with my father was that he was an emotionalist ashamed of\\nhis emotions. He wanted to be scrupulously just, and feared that his\\nsentiments would weaken his judgments. Temperamentally he was willing\\nto believe everything. But he had read Herbert Spencer and admired the\\nacademic mind; consequently he off-set his natural predisposition to\\nfaith by re-acting from everything accepted, and scrawled across the\\npage of recorded altruism a gigantic note of interrogation. He gave\\nto strangers and little boys the impression of being cynical and hard,\\nwhereas he had within him the smoldering enthusiasms and compassion\\nwhich go to the kindling of martyrs and saints. He was planned for a man\\nof action, but had turned aside to grope after phantoms in the mazes of\\nthe mind. His career is typical of the nineteenth century and sedentary\\nmodes of life.\\n\\nLooking back I often wonder if he would not have been happier as a\\nship-chandler, moving among jolly sea-captains, following his father’s\\ntrade. How many hours, mounting into years, he wasted on literary\\nfailures--hours which might have been spent on people and friendships.\\nAs a child I rarely saw him save at meal-times, and then he was\\npre-occupied. For some years after my mother’s death he was afraid to\\nlove anyone too dearly.\\n\\nHe solved the problem of my immediate existence by locking the door into\\nthe lane, and giving me the freedom of the garden. I can recall it in\\nevery phase. Other and more recent memories have passed away, but,\\nwhen I close my eyes and think back, I am there again. Moss-grown walks\\nspread before me. Peaches on the wall ripen. I catch the fragrance of\\nbox, basking in sunshine. I see my father’s study-window and the ivy\\nblown across the pane. He is seated at his desk, writing, writing. His\\nface is turned away. His head is supported on his hand as though weary.\\nI am wondering why it is that grown people never play, and why it is\\nthat they shut smaller people up always within walls.\\n\\nI saw nothing of the outside world except on Sundays. My father used to\\nlead me as far as the parish church, and call for me when service was\\nended. He never came inside. His intellectual integrity forbade it. He\\nwas an agnostic. My mother, knowing this, had made him promise to take\\nme. He kept his word exactly.\\n\\nFew friends called on us. My companions were cooks and housemaids. I\\nborrowed my impressions of life, as most children do, from the lower\\norders of society. A servant is a prisoner; so is a child. Both are\\nsubject to tyranny, and both are dependent for their happiness on\\nomnipotent persons’ moods and fortunes. A maidservant is always dreaming\\nof a day when she will marry a lord, and drive up in a glittering\\ncarriage to patronize her old employer. A child, sensitive to\\nmisunderstanding, has similar visions of a far-off triumph which will\\nconsist in heaping coals of fire. He will heap them kindly and for his\\nparents’ good, but unmistakably.\\n\\nIt was in Pope Lane that I first began to dream of a garden without\\nwalls. As I grew older I became curious, and fretted at the narrowness\\nof my restraint. What happened over there in the great beyond? Rumors\\ncame to me; sometimes it was the roar of London to the southward;\\nsometimes it was the sing-song of a mower traversing a neighbor’s lawn.\\nI dreamt of an unwalled garden, through which a child might wander on\\nforever--an Eden, where each step revealed a new beauty and a fresh\\nsurprise, where flowers grew always and there were no doors to lock.\\n\\nIt was a book which gave the first impulse to this thought; in a sense\\nit was responsible for the entire trend of my character and life. In\\nrecent years I have tried to procure a copy. All traces of it seem to\\nhave vanished. If I ever knew the name of the author I have forgotten\\nit. I am even uncertain of the exact title. I believe it was called _The\\nMagic Carpet_.\\n\\nMine was a big red copy. The color came off when your hands got sticky.\\nIt had to be supported on the knees when read, or the arms got tired. It\\nwas a story of children, ordered about by day, who by night went forth\\ninvisible to wander the world, riding on the nursery carpet. Absurd!\\nYes, but this carpet happened to be magic. All you had to do was to\\nseat yourself upon it, hold on tight, and wish where you wanted to be\\ncarried. In a trice you were beyond the reach of adults, flying over\\nroofs and spires, post-haste to the land of your desire. In that book\\nlittle boys ate as much as they liked and never had stomach-ache. They\\ndefeated whole armies of cannibals without a scratch. They rescued fair\\nladies, as old as housemaids, but ten times more beautiful, who wanted\\nto marry them. No one seemed to know that they were little. No one\\ncondescended or told them to run away and wash their faces. Nobody went\\nto school. Everybody was polite.\\n\\nThe pictures which illustrated the adventures still seem in remembrance\\nthe finest in the world. They typify the spirit of romance, the soul\\nof youth, the revolt against limitations. They appealed to the lawless\\nelement within me, which still yearns to straddle the stallion of the\\nworld and go plunging bare-back through space.\\n\\nI tried every carpet in the house, but none of ours were magic. I lay\\nawake imagining the lands, I would visit if I had it. I would go to\\nmy mother first, and try to bring her back. I remembered vaguely how\\ncare-free my father had been when we had had her with us. Perhaps, if\\nshe returned, he would be happy. Then an inspiration came; there was\\none carpet which I had _not_ tested--it lay before the fire-place in\\nmy father’s study. But how should I get at it? Only in the hours of\\ndarkness was it different from any other carpet, and in the evenings my\\nfather was always there. I never doubted but that this was the carpet;\\nits difficulty of access proved it.\\n\\nOne night I lay awake, pinching myself to stave off sleep. It was\\nwinter. Outside I could hear the trees cracking beneath the weight of\\nsnow upon their boughs. The servants came to bed. I saw them pass my\\ndoor, casting long shadows, screening their candles with their hands\\nlest the light should strike across my eyes and rouse me. I waited to\\nhear the study-door open and close. In waiting I began to drowse. I came\\nto myself with a shudder. What hour it was I could not guess. I got\\nout of bed. Stealing to the top of the stairs I looked down; all was\\nblackness. Listening, I could hear the heavy breathing of sleepers.\\nBare-footed, I crept down into the hall, clinging to the banisters. The\\nair was bitter. I was frightened. Each step I took seemed to cause the\\nhouse to groan and tremble. The door of the study stood open. By the\\nlight of the fire, dying in the grate, I could just make out the carpet.\\nDarting across the threshold, I knelt upon it. “Take me to Mama,”\\n I whispered. The minutes ticked by; it did not stir. I spoke again;\\nnothing happened.\\n\\nI heard a sound in the doorway--a sudden catching of the breath. I\\nturned. My father was standing, watching me. I did not scream or\\ncry out. He came toward me through the darkness. What with fear of\\nconsequences and disappointment, I fell to sobbing.\\n\\nI think he must have seen and overheard everything, for, with a\\ntenderness which had something hungry and awful about it, he gathered me\\nin his arms. Without a word of question or explanation, he carried me up\\nto bed. Before he left, he halted as though he were trying to utter some\\nthought which refused to get said. Suddenly he bent above the pillow,\\njust as my mother used to do, and kissed me on the forehead. His cheeks\\nwere salty.\\n\\nAs my eyes closed, a strange thing happened. The snow lay on the ground\\nand there were no flowers, but the room was filled with the fragrance of\\nviolets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III--THE SPUFFLER\\n\\nOne day there was a ring at the door in the lane, followed by a loud\\nand impatient rat-a-tat. A gentleman, who was a stranger to me, hurled\\nhimself across the threshold. He wore the frown of one who is intensely\\nin earnest, whose mind is very much occupied. His mustaches were the\\nfiercest and most eager that I ever saw on any man. They stuck out at\\nright angles from under his nose like a pair of shaving-brushes. They\\nwere of an extraordinary purplish color, and would have done credit to a\\npirate. But his dress was more clerical than sea-faring. It consisted\\nof a black frock coat, bound with braid at the edges where the cloth was\\nfretted; his vest was low-cut to display an ocean of white shirt, above\\nwhich a small tie of black silk wobbled. Hurrying up the path, tugging\\nat his bushy eye-brows, he disappeared into the house. The last I saw of\\nhim was a red bandana handkerchief, streaming like a danger-signal\\nfrom his coat-tail pocket. I thought he must be one of those hostile\\npublishers my father talked about or, at the very least, an editor.\\n\\nHetty, the maid, came into the garden looking worried. She did not stand\\non the steps and yell, as was customary, as though daring me to disobey\\nher. She caught up her skirts with a dignified air and spoke my name\\nsoftly, employing the honeyed tones with which she enticed our milkman\\nevery morning. I perceived at once that something momentous had\\noccurred, and came out from behind the bushes. Then I saw the reason for\\nher sudden change of manners--the purple mustached stranger was watching\\nus from behind the curtains of my father’s study-window. I was\\nmost agreeably and unpresentably grubby. Hetty was distressed at my\\nappearance; I knew she was by the way she kept hurting my hand and\\nmuttering to me to hide behind her.\\n\\nWhen we got inside the house she became voluble, but only in whispers.\\n\\n“Now, Master Dante, I can’t ’elp it if the soap do get into your\\nmouth. You’ve got to be a clean boy fer once in yer h’existence. It may\\nmean h’everythin’. That gent’s some relation o’ yourn. ’E’s goin’ to\\ntake you away wiv him, an’ he may ’ave money. I shall ’ate to lose\\nyer. Now let’s look at yer neck.”\\n\\nShe scrubbed away at my face till it was scarlet; she let the water from\\nthe flannel trickle down my back. I was too awe-inspired to wriggle; by\\nsome occult power the dreadful personage downstairs might learn about\\nit. Having been pitched into my Sunday sailor-suit and squeezed into a\\npair of new boots and prickly stockings, I was bundled into the august\\npresence.\\n\\nWhen I entered he was straddling the fire-place carpet--the one which\\nought to have been magic--and waggling his coat-tails with his hands.\\n\\nMy father rose from his chair. “This is your great-uncle, Obadiah\\nSpreckles. Come and be introduced, Dante.”\\n\\nUp to now I had never heard of such a relative, but I came timidly\\nforward and shook hands.\\n\\n“A fine little fellow. A very fine little fellow, and the image of his\\nmother,” said my great-uncle.\\n\\nMy father winced at the mention of my mother. My great-uncle spread his\\nlegs still wider and addressed me in a jerky important manner.\\n\\n“Got a lot of dogs and cats. Got a goat and a cow. Got some hens. Got up\\nearly this morning. Saw the sun shining. Thought you might like to take\\na look at ’em, young man.”\\n\\nTurning to my father, “Well, Cardover, I must be going. I’ll take good\\ncare of him and all that. I’m very busy--hardly a moment to spare.”\\n\\nBefore I knew what had happened, I had said good-bye to my father and\\nwas standing in the lane alone with my strange uncle.\\n\\nWhen the door had banged and he knew that no grownup could see him,\\nhe changed his manner. His hurry left him. Placing his hands on my\\nshoulders, he looked down into my face, laughing. “Now for a good time,\\nold chap.”\\n\\nAt the end of the lane, where the posts blocked the passage, stood a\\nlittle dog-cart and pony. My bag was stowed under the seat; at a click\\nof the tongue from my uncle, the little beast started up like the wind.\\n\\nIt was a bright June morning. The sky was intensely blue and cloudless.\\nThe air was full of flower-fragrance and dreamy somnolence. I had seen\\nso little of the world that everything was vivid to me, and touched with\\nthe vagrant poetry of romance. Tram-lines were streaks of silver down\\nthe streets, shops were palaces, cabbies gentlemen who plied their\\ntrade because they loved horses. Postmen going their rounds were\\nphilanthropists. Everyone was free, doing what he liked, and happy.\\nIn my child’s way I realized that neither my father nor myself was\\ntypical--not all little boys were locked in gardens and not all grown\\nmen slaved from morning to midnight. A great lump came into my throat.\\nIt would have been quite easy to cry, I was so glad.\\n\\nUncle Obadiah kept chatting away, telling me that the name of his little\\nmare was Dollie and how he came to buy her. “Couldn’t afford it, you\\nknow, old chap. She costs me ten shillings a week for fodder. But when I\\nsaw that coster whacking her, and she looked up into my eyes when I went\\nto stop him, I just couldn’t resist her. She seemed to be asking me to\\nbuy her, and I did. You should have heard what your Aunt Lavinia said.”\\n\\nAll the way along the streets he kept pointing with his whip to things\\nthat he thought were interesting. He engaged me in conversation--a thing\\nwhich no one had thought worth doing. He asked me questions which were\\nnot senseless, and seemed to suppose that a child had reasoning powers.\\nI was flattered, and began to surprise myself by the boldness of the\\nthings I said.\\n\\nWe rattled down the City Road, past the Mansion House, over London\\nBridge to the Elephant and Castle, and so out toward Dulwich till we\\ncame within sight of the Crystal Palace.\\n\\nHe began to slow down and grow pensive, as though working out a problem.\\n“You see, she’ll have lunch ready. She’s expecting us. She’s very\\nprecise about the keeping of hours and won’t like it.” Then, “Hang it\\nall. We may as well have a holiday now we’re out.”\\n\\nShaking loose the reins we started forward again, racing everything we\\nmet upon the road. My uncle’s high spirits returned. I don’t know where\\nwe went. I know there were woods and farm-houses. We stopped for lunch\\nat a village-inn. It stood on the edge of a gorse-common. On the common\\na donkey was grazing. A flock of geese wandered across it. Boys were\\nplaying cricket against a tree-stump. Several great wagons, piled high\\nwith vegetables, were drawn up, the horses with their heads deep in\\nnose-bags.\\n\\nWe had our meal in the tap-room with the wagoners. While they were\\npresent my uncle assumed his pontifical manner, addressing me as\\n“young man” and them as “my good fellows.” He was very dignified, and\\nbenevolent, and haughty. They were much impressed. But when they had\\nleft and we were alone, he winked his eye at me solemnly, as much as to\\nsay “that was all pretense. Now let’s be natural,” and entered once more\\ninto my boy’s world of escapades and gilded shadows.\\n\\nWhile the mare rested, we strolled round. In a hollow of the woods we\\ncame across a gipsy encampment. Three yellow caravans were drawn up\\ntogether. A fire was burning in the open, over which an iron pot was\\nsuspended from a bough. A fierce, gaudily clad woman was bent above it\\nstirring. She looked up at sound of our approach and the big ear-rings\\nwhich dropped upon her neck jangled. Recognizing my uncle she nodded,\\nand allowed us to sit down and watch her. Presently a rough man came out\\nof the woods and threw himself down beside us. A young woman returned\\nfrom fortune-telling, with her baby in a shawl across her shoulders.\\nBowls were brought out, and we had a second lunch from the great pot\\nbubbling on the fire. Pipes were produced; the women smoked as well as\\nthe men. My uncle asked them where they had been and how they had fared\\nsince last he saw them. I listened intently to their answers; it seemed\\nthat they must have discovered the boundless garden of which I had only\\ndreamt.\\n\\nIn the dog-cart on the homeward journey, I learnt that my uncle was\\nacquainted with a number of queer people. “Everybody’s interesting,\\nDante,” he said, by way of excuse and explanation; “it’s never safe to\\ndespise anyone.”\\n\\nIn course of conversation he informed me that he had always longed to be\\na gipsy, but had never dared. When I asked why not, he answered shortly,\\n“Your Aunt Lavinia--she’s not like us and wouldn’t understand.”\\n\\n“But if there wasn’t any Aunt Lavinia--would you dare then?”\\n\\n“I might have to,” he said, smiling grimly.\\n\\nI didn’t know at all what he meant. He didn’t intend I should. After all\\nthese years those words, chance-spoken to a child, remain with me. They\\nwere as near to a confession that his wife supported him as was possible\\nfor a proud man.\\n\\nMy grandmother Cardover at Ransby, whose sister he had married, had a\\nhabit of nicknaming people with words of her own invention. She called\\nmy great-uncle The Spuffler. Whether the verb _to Spuffle_ is Suffolk\\ndialect or a word of her own coining, I have never been able to find\\nout--but in its hostile sense it described him exactly.\\n\\nA spuffler is a gay pretender, who hides his lack of success beneath the\\nimportance of his manners. Time is his one possession, and to him it is\\nvalueless; yet he tries to impress the world with its extreme rarity.\\nA spuffler is always in a hurry; he talks loudly. He plays a game of\\nmake-believe that he is a person of far-reaching authority; he deceives\\nothers and almost deceives himself. He is usually small in stature and\\nnot infrequently bald-headed. In conversing he makes an imaginary lather\\nwith his hands and points his finger, at you. He may splutter and spit\\nwhen he gets excited; but this is accidental and not necessary.\\nThe prime requisite is that he should affect the prosperity of a\\nbank-president and be dependent on some quite obscure source for his\\npocket-money. Since I have lived in America I have become familiar with\\na word which is very similar--_a bluffer_. But a bluffer is a conscious\\nliar and may be a humorist, whereas a spuffler does all in his power to\\ndeceive himself and is always in dead earnest.\\n\\nIt is a curious fact that the men whom I loved best as a child were\\nall three incompetents in the worldly sense. They were clever, but they\\nlacked the faculty of marketing their talents. They were boys in\\nmen’s bodies. With children they had the hearts of children and were\\ndelightful. With business men their light-heartedness counted as\\nirresponsibility and was a drawback. In two out of the three cases\\nnamed, the disappointments which resulted from continual defeat produced\\nvices. Only my Uncle Obadiah, clad in his armor of unpierceable\\nspuffle, rode through the ranks of life scatheless, with his sweetness\\nunembittered and his integrity untarnished. But they were all good men.\\n\\nThrough the June twilight we returned to the outskirts of London. We\\nturned in at a ruined gateway, and rode through a tunnel of overhanging\\ntrees where laburnum blazed through the dusk. A long rambling house grew\\nup before us. At one time it must have been the country estate of some\\ncity-merchant. At sound of our wheels on the gravel, the front-door\\nopened and a little lady stepped out to greet us. She was neat and\\nspeckless as a hospital nurse. Her body was slim and dainty as a girl’s.\\nThere was an air of decision and restraint about her, which was in\\ndirect opposition to my uncle’s hurried geniality.\\n\\nWhen we had halted, she lifted me out of the dog-cart and carried me\\ninto the house to a large room at the back, which looked into a shadowy\\ngarden and a paddock beyond. It seemed older and more opulent than any\\nhouse I had known as yet. There was so much space about it.\\n\\nMy uncle came in from stabling Dollie. “Well, Lavinia, I couldn’t get\\nhome to lunch. Very sorry, but it couldn’t be helped.”\\n\\nHe darted a look across at me, wondering how much I had told her.\\nThe secret was established; I knew that I must hold my tongue. I knew\\nsomething else--that he was afraid of her. Throughout the meal he kept\\nup a stream of strenuous pretense, discussing large plans aloud with\\nhimself. What they were I cannot now remember. I suppose my grandmother\\nwould have called them spuffle. Suddenly he rose from the table, saying\\nthat he had a lot of letters to answer and excused himself. But when I\\nwent into his room an hour later to bid him good-night, he was sitting\\nbefore his desk, doing nothing in particular, biting the end of his pen.\\n\\nWhen my aunt and I were left together I felt very lonely at first. She\\nhad sat so silent all through supper.\\n\\nBut when the door had closed, she turned to me laughing. I knew at once\\nthat, like most grown-ups when they are together, she had only been\\nshamming. Now she was-going to be real.\\n\\n“Did you have a good day in the country?” she asked. “Oh, he can’t\\ndeceive me; I could tell by the dust on the wheels.”\\n\\nThen, realizing, I suppose, that it was not fair to pump me, she stopped\\nasking questions and began to speak about myself. She drew up a chair\\nto the window and sat with me in the dark with her arms about me. She\\nseemed extraordinarily young, and when her silky gray hair touched my\\ncheek as she bent above me, I wondered what had made my uncle say that\\nshe wasn’t like us and wouldn’t understand.\\n\\nThey each had their secret world of desire: his was the open road, where\\nliberty was and lack of convention; hers was a home with fire-light and\\nchildren. She was childless. Into both these worlds a little boy might\\nenter. That night as I lay awake in bed I was puzzled. Why was it that\\ngrown people were so funny, and could never be real with one another?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV--RUTHITA\\n\\nIt was my Uncle Obadiah who first opened my eyes to the mysteries of\\nthe animal world. In so doing he flung wide a door into happiness which\\nmany a wiser man has neglected. He derived nearly all his pleasures from\\nthe cheerful little things of life. A curious sympathy existed between\\nhim and the lower creation. All the cats and dogs in the district were\\nhis friends. He attributed to them almost human personalities, and gave\\nthem special names of his own choosing. It was a wonderful day for me\\nwhen he first made me realize that all-surrounding was a kingdom of\\nbeasts and birds of which I, who had always been ruled, might be ruler.\\n\\nIn the paddock which lay between the garden and orchard, he had his\\nown especial kingdom. His subjects were a cow, a goat, some very\\ndomestically inclined rabbits, about a hundred hens, and innumerable\\nLondon sparrows. The latter he had trained to fly down from the trees\\nand settle on his shoulders when he whistled.\\n\\nEarly in the morning we would go there together; the first duty of\\nthe day was to feed the menagerie. How distinctly I can recall those\\nscenes--the dewy lawn, dappled golden by sunlight falling through\\nleaves, the droning of bees setting forth from hives on their day’s\\nexcursion, the smoke slowly rising in the summer stillness from distant\\nchimney-pots, and my uncle’s voice making excited guesses at how many\\neggs we should gather.\\n\\nEggs represented almost his sole contribution to the family income.\\nAmong his many Eldorados was the persistent belief that he could make\\nhis fortune at poultryraising. He would talk to me about it for hours\\nas we worked in the garden, like a man inspired, making lightning\\ncalculations of the sums he would one day realize. He was continually\\nexperimenting and crossing breeds with a view to producing a more\\nprolific strain of layers. He had a dream that one day he would produce\\nthe finest strain of fowl in the world. He would call it _The Spreckles_\\n--his name would be immortalized. He would be justified in the eyes of\\nAunt Lavinia; and success would justify him in the eyes of all men.\\n\\nMeanwhile my aunt declared that Obad spent more time and thought on that\\nblest live-stock than he would ever see back in money. “Obad” was her\\ncontraction for his name; when she spoke to him sharply it sounded like\\nher opinion of his character. But, in her own way, she was fond of him.\\nPerhaps she had come to love his very failings as we do the faults of\\nour friends. She was secretly proud of her own capacity; her thwarted\\nmother-instinct found an outlet in the sense of his dependence.\\nNevertheless, the great fundamental cleavage lay between them: she lived\\nin an anxious world where tradesmen’s bills required punctual payment;\\nhis world was a careless playground in which no defeat was ever final.\\nShe was stable in her moods, self-reliant and tenaciously courageous.\\nHe was forever changing: with adults he was like a house in mourning,\\nshuttered, austere, grave; but should a youngster pass by, the blinds\\nwere jerked aside and a laughing face peered out.\\n\\nHis most important make-believe was that he was a benefactor\\nof humanity. He held honorary positions of secretary to various\\nphilanthropic societies--_The Society for the Housing of Gipsies; The\\nSociety for the Assisting of Decrepit Ladies_, etc. The positions were\\nhonorary because he could find no one willing to pay him. He worked for\\nnothing because he was ashamed of being forever out of employment. He\\ngot great credit for his services among charitable people; the annual\\nvotes of thanks which he received helped to bolster up his self-respect\\nthroughout the year.\\n\\nAs I grew older and more observant, I used to wonder what had induced my\\naunt to marry him. Again it was my Grandmother Cardover who told me, “He\\nspuffled Lavinia into it, my dear.” It seems that he caught her by the\\nvast commercial and humanitarian possibilities of one of his many plans.\\nWhen she awoke to the fact that her husband was not a man, but the\\nincarnation of perpetual boyhood, she may have been disappointed, but\\nshe did not show it. Like a sensible woman, instead of crying her eyes\\nout, she set about earning a livelihood. Uncle Obad had one marketable\\nasset--his religion and the friends he gained by it. She took a decayed\\nmansion in Charity Grove and established a Christian Boarding House. All\\nher lodgers were young men, and by that proud subterfuge of poverty they\\nwere known as paying-guests.\\n\\nThe only Christian feature that I can remember about her establishment\\nwas that my uncle said grace before all meals at which the lodgers\\nwere present. At the midday meal, from which they were absent, it was\\nomitted. The Christian Boarding House idea caught on with provincial\\nparents whose sons were moving up to the city for the first time; it\\nseemed to guarantee home morals. The sons soon perceived how matters\\nstood and buried their agnostic prejudices beneath good feeding.\\n\\nA general atmosphere of obligation was created by my aunt in her\\nhusband’s favor; she always spoke as though it was very kind of so\\npublic a man as Mr. Spreckles to squander his scanty privacy by letting\\npaying-guests share his roof. She made such a gallant show with what she\\nearned that everyone thought her husband had a private fortune, which\\nenabled him to live in such style and give so much time to charitable\\nworks. She would hint as much in conversing with her friends, and\\ninvariably feigned the greatest pride and contentment in his activities.\\nThanks to his spuffling and her courage, there were not five people\\noutside the family who ever guessed the true circumstances.\\n\\nBut when all is said, the real business of my Uncle Obad’s life was not\\nphilanthropy or running a boardinghouse, but poultry-raising. It was\\nhe who gave me the old white hen, without which I might never have\\nmet Ruthita. My money-making instincts were roused by his talk of the\\nprofits to be derived from eggs. I was enthusiastic to follow in his\\nfootsteps. To this end, at the hour of parting, when I was returning to\\nPope Lane, he gave me an ancient white Leghorn. He did not tell me she\\nwas ancient; he recommended her to me as belonging to a strain that\\ncould never get broody.\\n\\nOn the long drive home across London, my grief at leaving Charity\\nGrove was partly mitigated by my new possession. It was a tremendous\\nexperience to feel that I had it in my power to make a live thing, even\\nthough it were but a hen, sad or happy. I discussed with Uncle Obad all\\nthe care that was necessary for egg-production. I got him to work out\\nsums for me. If my hen were to lay an egg every other day throughout the\\nyear, how much money would I make by selling each egg to my father at a\\npenny? I felt that the foundations of my financial fortunes were secure.\\nThe genuineness of my expectations made my uncle restless and ashamed;\\nhe knew that the hen had passed her first youth, and suggested that\\npepper in her food might help matters.\\n\\nIt was supper-time when I arrived home. I let the hen loose on the\\nlawn to stretch her legs. My father was busy as usual, but he delayed a\\nlittle longer over the meal in honor of my home-coming.\\n\\nSome of the things I blurted out about my uncle must have revealed to\\nhim the comradeship that lay between us. He had risen from the table,\\nbut he sat down again. “You have known your uncle just a fortnight,” he\\nsaid, “and yet you seem to have told him more about yourself than you\\nhave told me in all these years. Why is it, Dante? You’re not afraid of\\nme? It can’t be that.” We were both of us shy. He reached over and took\\nmy hand, repeating, “It can’t be that.”\\n\\nHe knew that it was that and so did I. Yet he was hungry for my\\naffection. He was making an unaccustomed effort to win my confidence and\\ndraw me out. But he spoke to me as though I was a grown man, whereas my\\nuncle to get near me had become himself a child. If he had only talked\\nto me about my white hen, I should have chattered. But I was awed by his\\nembarrassment, and remained silent and unresponsive.\\n\\nHe went on to tell me that all the time he was away from me in his study\\nhe was working for my sake. “I want to have the money to give you a good\\nstart in life. I never had it. You must succeed where I have failed.”\\n\\nI understood very little of what he was saying except that money and\\nsuccess seemed to be the same. That was the way Uncle Obad had talked\\nabout poultry-raising. I had no idea where money came from or how it was\\nobtained. I must have asked him some question about it, for I recall one\\nof the phrases he used in replying, “A man succeeds not by what he does,\\nbut by the things at which he has aimed.”\\n\\nThe red sun fell behind the trees while we talked, peered above my\\nfather’s shoulder, and sank out of sight. It was dusk when I ran into\\nthe garden.\\n\\nI felt prisoned again--the door into the lane was locked and the walls\\nwere all about me. The lamp in my father’s study was kindled and flung a\\nbar of light across the shrubbery. He was working to get the money that\\nI might be allowed to work. I didn’t like the idea. I didn’t want to\\nwork. Why couldn’t one drive always through the sunshine, pulling up at\\ntaverns and sitting beside gipsy camp-fires?\\n\\nI commenced to search for the white hen and so forgot these economic\\ncomplications. Here and there I came across places where she had\\nbeen scrabbing, but I could see her nowhere. At last I discovered her\\nroosting on the branch of an apple-tree which grew close by the wall at\\nthe end of the garden. I spoke to her kindly, but she refused to come\\ndown. She was too high up for me to reach her from the ground. When I\\nscattered grain, she blinked at me knowingly, as much as to say, “Surely\\nyou don’t think I’m as big a fool as that.” It seemed to me that she was\\ngrieving for all the cocks and hens to whom she had said farewell. She\\nwas embittered against me because she was solitary. I explained to her\\nthat, if she’d lay eggs, I’d buy her a husband. She remained skeptical\\nof my good intentions. There was nothing for it--but to climb. I could\\nhear the leaves shaking and the apples bumping on the ground; my hand\\nwas stretched out to catch her when, with a hoarse scream of defiance,\\nshe flapped her wings and disappeared into the great nothingness over\\nour neighbor’s wall.\\n\\nUnless the white hen had blazed the trail, I might have remained in the\\nwalled-in garden for years without ever daring to discover a way out.\\nI was too excited at this crisis to measure my temerity. In my fear of\\nlosing her I did a thing undreamt of and unplanned--I swung myself from\\nthe branch on to the top of the brickwork and dropped on the other side.\\nA bed of currant bushes broke my fall. I got upon my feet scratched and\\ndazed.\\n\\nThe first thing I saw was a long stretch of grass bordered by flowers.\\nAt the end of it was a small two-storied house, gabled and with verandas\\nrunning round it. In one of the upper-story windows a light was burning;\\nall the rest was in darkness. In the middle of the lawn I could see my\\nwhite hen strutting in a very stately manner. I stole up behind her,\\nbut she began clucking. In my fear of discovery, I lost all patience and\\ncommenced to chase her vigorously. I ran her at last into a bed of peas,\\nwhere she became entangled. I had her in my arms when I heard a voice,\\n“Who are you?”\\n\\nTurning suddenly, I found that a little girl was standing close behind\\nme.\\n\\n“My name’s Dante.”\\n\\n“And mine’s Ruthita.”\\n\\nWe stared at one another through the dusk. I had never spoken to a\\nlittle girl and for some reason, difficult to explain, commenced to\\ntremble. It was not fear that caused it, but something strong and\\nemotional.\\n\\n“Dante,” she whispered. “How pretty!” Then, “Where do you live?”\\n\\nI jerked my thumb in the direction of the wall.\\n\\n“You climbed over?”\\n\\nI nodded. She laughed softly. “Could you do it again? Oh, do come often,\\noften. I’m so lonely, and we could play together.”\\n\\nJust then the voice of Hetty began to call in the distance,\\n\\n“Dan-tee, Dan-tee, where are you? Come to bed di-rectly.”\\n\\nHer voice drew nearer. She was searching for me, and passed quite close\\nto us on the other side of the wall. We could hear the indignant rustle\\nof her skirt and her heavy breathing with bending down so low to peer\\nunder bushes.\\n\\nRuthita came near to me so that I had my first glimpse of her eyes in\\nthe dark--eyes which were always to haunt me. Her hands were clasped\\nagainst her throat in eagerness--she seemed to be standing tiptoe.\\n“Don’t tell,” she pleaded. “It’s our secret. But come again to-morrow.”\\n\\nI promised.\\n\\nShe watched me scrambling for a foot-hold in the wall. When I sat\\nastride it, just before I vanished, she waved her hand.\\n\\nThe white hen had lost her importance in my thoughts;\\nI bundled her into the tool-house, and then surrendered to Hetty. Hetty\\nwas very cross. She wanted to discover where I had been hiding, but I\\nwouldn’t tell her. When she left me, I crept out of bed and knelt beside\\nthe window for a long time gazing down into the blackness.\\n\\nFar away a bird was calling. The tall trees waved their arms. The moon\\nleapt out of clouds, and the branches reached up to touch her with their\\nfingers. A little beam of light struggled free and ran about the garden.\\nI tried to tell myself it was Ruthita.\\n\\nThe garden seemed less of a prison now--rather a place of magic and\\nenchantment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V--MARRIAGE ACCORDING TO HETTY\\n\\nNext morning I was up early. Spiders’ webs were still crystal with dew\\nin the garden; they had not yet been tattered by the sun lifting up the\\nflowers’ heads. I had no hope that I would see Ruthita, but I wanted to\\npeep across the wall while everyone was in bed and there was no one to\\nobserve me.\\n\\nI had covered half the distance to the apple-tree, when I heard a sound\\nof voices. They came from behind the tool-house. I fisted my hands and\\nlistened. A man and woman were conversing, but in such low tones that I\\ncould hear nothing that was said. I made sure they were thieves who had\\nheard about my hen, and had come to rob me. I looked back at the windows\\nof our house. All the blinds were lowered; everyone was sleeping. There\\nwas no sign of life anywhere, save the hopping of early risen blackbirds\\nbetween bushes in search of early risen worms. With a quickly beating\\nheart I crouched beside the wall, advancing under cover of a row of\\nsunflowers. Looking out from between their stalks, I discovered a man\\nsitting on a wheelbarrow; a woman was balanced on his knee with her arm\\nabout his neck. The woman was Hetty and the man was our gardener.\\n\\nHetty was wearing her starched print-dress, ready to begin her morning’s\\nwork. She wasn’t a bit scornful or solemn, but was laughing and\\nwriggling and tossing her head. She seemed quite a different person\\nfrom the stern, moral housemaid, God’s intimate friend, who told me\\neverything that God had thought about me through the day when at night\\nshe was putting me to bed. Up to that moment it had never occurred to me\\nthat she was pretty, but now her cheeks were flushed and the sun was\\nin her rumpled hair. While I watched, our gardener drew her close and\\nkissed her. She squeaked like a little mouse, and pretended to struggle\\nto free herself.\\n\\nI never dreamt that grown people ever behaved like that. I hadn’t the\\nfaintest notion what she was doing or why she was doing it; but I knew\\nthat it was something secret, and silly, and beautiful. I also had the\\nfeeling that it was something pleasant and wrong, just like the things\\nI most enjoyed doing, for which I was punished. I wanted to withdraw and\\ntried to; but tripped over the sunflowers and fell.\\n\\nHetty and the gardener sprang apart. I knew what was going to happen\\nnext; I had caught them being natural--they were going to commence\\nshamming. The gardener became very busy, piling his tools into the\\nbarrow. Hetty, talking in her cold and distant manner, said to him, “And\\ndon’t forget the lettuce for breakfast, John. Master’s very partic’lar\\nabout it.”\\n\\nI came from my hiding, thrusting my hands deep in my pockets, as though\\nI kept my courage there and was frightened of its dropping out. The\\ngardener’s back was towards me, but he caught sight of me from between\\nhis legs. He just stopped like that with his face growing redder, his\\nmouth wide-open, and stared. Hetty didn’t look as pretty as she had been\\nlooking, but before she could say anything I said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t\\nmean to. I came to see my fowl---- but I won’t tell.”\\n\\n“Bless ’is little ’eart,” cried John; “I thought it were ’is Pa, I\\nwuz that scared.”\\n\\nHetty knelt down beside me and rocked me to and fro half-hysterically,\\nmaking me promise again and again that I would never tell.\\n\\n“Was you doin’ somethin’ wrong?” I asked. “What was you doin’?”\\n\\nThey looked foolishly at one another.\\n\\nAll that day they kept me near them on one pretext or another, afraid\\nto let me get away from them. I had never known them so sensible and\\nobliging; they did all kinds of things for me that they had never done\\nbefore. After breakfast, while Hetty was dusting, John built me a little\\nfowl-run. In the afternoon, while he was cutting the grass, Hetty sat\\nwith me beneath the apple-tree and told me what life meant. She spoke\\nin whispers like a conspirator, and all the time that she was talking, I\\ncould hear Ruthita humming just the other side of the wall.\\n\\nAs I understood it, this was what she told me. When you first get here,\\n_here_ being the world, you own nothing; and know nothing. Then, as you\\ngrow up, you know something but still own nothing. That’s why you’re\\nordered about and told not to do all the things that you want most to\\ndo. You can only please yourself when nobody’s looking and must obey\\nnearly everyone until you get money. There are several ways of getting\\nit, and the pleasantest is sweet-hearting.\\n\\nHere I interrupted her to inquire what was sweet-hearting. “Well,”\\n she said, turning her face away and looking dreamily at John, who was\\npushing the mower across the lawn, “sweet-heartin’s what you saw me and\\nJohn doin’.”\\n\\n“Does it always have to be done before breakfast?”\\n\\nShe threw back her head and laughed, swaying backwards and forwards.\\nThen she became solemn and answered, “I ’ave to do it before breakfast\\n’cause I’m a servant. But I does it of evenin’s on my night out.”\\n\\nShe went on to tell me that sweet-hearting was the first step towards\\nfreedom and money. The second step was a honeymoon, which consisted in\\ngoing away with a person of the other sex for a week to some place where\\nyou weren’t known. When you came back to the people who knew you, they\\nsaid you were married. So marriage was the third and last step. After\\nthat you were given a house, and money, and all the things for which you\\nhad always yearned. You had other people, who were like you were before\\nyou went sweet-hearting, to take your orders, and run your errands, and\\nsay “Sir” or “Madam.” Sometimes when you came back from your honeymoon,\\nyou found children in the house.\\n\\nSo through that long summer’s afternoon beneath the apple-tree, with the\\nleaves gently stirring and the sound of Ruthita humming across the wall,\\nI gained my first lesson in sexology and domestic economics. It solved a\\ngood many problems by which I had been puzzled. For instance, why Uncle\\nObad had a pony and I hadn’t; why I was sent to bed always at the same\\nhour and my father went only when he chose; why big people could lose\\ntheir tempers without being wicked, whereas God was always angry when\\nI did it. There was only one thing that I couldn’t understand: why two\\nboys couldn’t go on a honeymoon together, or two girls, and have the\\nsame results follow. Except for this, the riddle of society was now\\nsolved as far as I was concerned. Marriage seemed a thousand times more\\nwonderful than the magic carpet.\\n\\nI was tremendously interested in the possibilities of sweet-hearting and\\npromised to help Hetty all I could. In return she declared that, when\\nshe was married, she would persuade my father to let her take me out of\\nthe garden.\\n\\nThat evening I crept over the wall and found Ruthita waiting. She was\\na slim dainty little figure, clad in a short white dress. She had\\ngreat gray eyes, and long black hair and lashes. Her voice was soft and\\ncaressing, like the twittering of a bird in the ivy when one wakens on a\\nsummer morning. I told her in hurried whispers what I had discovered.\\nIt was all news to her. She slipped her hand into mine while I spoke and\\nnestled closer.\\n\\n“Little boy,” she whispered when I had ended, “you _are_ funny! You come\\nclimbing over the garden-wall and you tell me everything.”\\n\\nAn old man came out of the house and began to pace up and down the\\nwalks. His head was bent forward on his chest and he had a big red scar\\non his forehead. A cloak hung loosely from his shoulders. He carried\\na stick in his hand on which he leant heavily. Ruthita said he was her\\ngrandfather. Soon he began to call for her, and she had to go to him.\\n\\nLittle by little I learnt her story. Her grandfather was a French\\ngeneral. He had fought in the Franco-Prussian War until the Fall of the\\nEmpire and Proclamation of the Republic. Shortly after the flight of the\\nEmpress Eugénie he had come to England in disgust. His son, Ruthita’s\\nfather, had stayed behind and been cut to pieces in the Siege of Paris.\\nRuthita’s mother was an Englishwoman. She had never recovered from the\\nshock of her husband’s death. It was her light that I saw burning in the\\nbedroom window of evenings. They were almost poor now and lived in great\\nseclusion. The grandfather had dropped his rank and was known as plain\\nMonsieur Favart. So Ruthita was even a closer prisoner than myself.\\n\\nWhat did we talk about in those first stolen hours of’ childish\\nfriendship? I asked her once when we were grown up, but she could not\\ntell me. Perhaps we did not say much. We felt together--felt the\\nmystery of the enchanted unseen world. Why, the pigeons strutting on the\\nhousetops had seen more than we had; and they were not half as old as we\\nwere! They spread their wings, soared up into the clouds, and vanished.\\nWe told one another stories of where they went; but long before the\\nstories were ended Monsieur Favart would come searching for Ruthita or\\nthe voice of Hetty would ring through the dusk, calling me to bed. Then\\nI would lie awake and imagine myself a pigeon, and finish the story to\\nmyself.\\n\\nThe great beauty of our meetings was that they were undiscovered. It was\\nalways I who went to Ruthita--she was nothing of a climber, and the red\\nbricks and green moss would have left tell-tale marks upon her dress. We\\nhad a nest of straw behind the currant bushes. Here, with backs against\\nthe hard wall and fingers digging in the cool damp earth, we would sit\\nand wonder, talking in whispers, of all the mysteries that lay before\\nus. Ruthita had vague memories of Paris, of soldiers marching and the\\nbeating of drums. Sometimes she would sing French songs to me, of which\\nshe would translate the meaning between each verse. My contribution\\nto our little store of knowledge was limited to what I have written in\\nthese few chapters.\\n\\nI don’t know at what stage in the proceedings our great idea occurred.\\nIt must have been in the early autumn, for the evenings were drawing in\\nand often it was chilly. I had been talking about Hetty, when suddenly I\\nexclaimed, “Why can’t we do that?”\\n\\n“Do what?” she questioned.\\n\\n“Get married!”\\n\\nThen I reminded her of the extreme simplicity of marriage as explained\\nby our housemaid. All we had to do was to slip out of the garden for\\na few days, and then come back. We should find a house ready for us.\\nPerhaps I should have a pony like Uncle Obad, and, instead of dolls,\\nRuthita would have real babies. It was the real babies that caught her\\nfancy. Because of her mother, she needed a little persuading. “What will\\nshe do wivout me?”\\n\\n“And what would she do if you’d never been borned?” I said.\\n\\nRuthita had five shillings in her money-box. I had only a shilling;\\nfor the white hen, in spite of pepper, had failed to lay any eggs. Six\\nshillings seemed to us a fortune--ample to provide for the honeymoon of\\ntwo small children.\\n\\nThe gate from Monsieur Favart’s garden was never locked: that was\\nevidently our easiest way out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI--THE YONDER LAND\\n\\nWhat did we hope to find that autumn morning when we slipped through\\nthat narrow door, forsaking the walls? It was all a guess to us--what\\nlay beyond; but we knew that it must be something splendid. Of one thing\\nwe were quite certain: that at the end of a few days we should have\\ngrown tall; we should return to Pope Lane a man and woman. The little\\nhouse would be there waiting, magically built in our hours of absence.\\nPerhaps work had been begun already upon the babies that Ruthita wanted.\\n\\nFor the first time I had kissed her that morning, awkwardly and shyly,\\nfeeling that somehow it was proper. At any rate, Hetty and our gardener\\nalways kissed when they got the chance and no one was looking.\\n\\nMonsieur Favart’s door swung to behind us. We ran as quickly as our legs\\nwould carry us. The fear of pursuit was upon us. Pinned to the pillow of\\neach of our empty beds was a sheet of paper on which was scrawled, “_Gon\\nto git Maried.”_\\n\\nWhen at last we halted for breath, we seemed to have covered many miles\\nof our journey. We were standing in a long, quaint street. On one side\\nflowed a river, railed in so we couldn’t get near it. On the other\\nside stood an irregular row of substantial houses, for the most part\\ncreeper-covered. No faces appeared in the houses’ windows. No one passed\\nup or down the street. It was as yet too early. It seemed that the world\\nwas empty, and that we and the birds were its only tenants. We turned\\nto the right, half-walking, half-running. I held Ruthita’s hand tightly;\\nthe feel of it gave me courage.\\n\\nWe must have made a queer pair in the mellow autumn sunlight. Ruthita\\nwore a white dress with a red cloak flung over it. On her head was a\\nyellow straw poke-bonnet, which made her face look strangely small.\\nShe had on black shoes, fastened by a single strap, and black and white\\nsocks which, when she ran, kept dropping.\\n\\nWe had no idea of direction, but just hurried on with a vague idea that\\nwe must keep moving forward.\\n\\nPresently we came across a drover, driving a flock of bewildered, tired\\nsheep. He was a lame man. He had an inflamed red face and one of his\\neyes was out. When he wanted to make his flock move faster, he jabbed\\nviciously at their tails with a pointed stick and started hopping from\\nside to side, barking like a dog. He passed right by us, saying nothing,\\nwaving a red flag in his left hand with which he would sometimes mop\\nhis forehead. We followed. We followed him through streets of shops all\\nshuttered; we followed him up a broad-paved hill; we followed him down a\\nwinding lane to a bridge across a river, beyond which lay marshes. Then\\nhe turned and called to us.\\n\\n“Little master, where be you goin’ and why be you followin’?”\\n\\nTo the country, I told him, to find the forest. I wanted to show Ruthita\\nthe unwalled garden through which my uncle had led me.\\n\\nThe man screwed up his one eye, and gazed upon us shrewdly. “You be wery\\nsmall to be goin’ to the forest. But so be you’re travellin’ along my\\nroute you might as well ’elp an old feller.”\\n\\nWe made our bargain with him. We would help him with his sheep, if he\\nwould guide us to the forest. We ran beside him across the short, crisp\\ngrass, imitating his cries to prevent the sheep from scattering. He told\\nus that he had driven them from Epping up to London, but that times were\\ncruel bad and the farmer who employed him had been unable to sell\\nthem. “It’s cruel ’ard on a man o’ my years,” he kept saying, “cruel\\n’ard.”\\n\\nWhen I asked him what was cruel hard, he shook his head as though\\nlanguage failed to express his wrongs: “The world in gineral.”\\n\\nThere was one of the sheep whose leg was broken. It kept lagging behind\\nthe rest, which made the man jab at it furiously. Ruthita’s eyes filled\\nwith tears of indignation when she saw it. She stamped her little foot\\nand insisted that he should not do it. The man pushed back his battered\\nhat and scratched his forehead, staring at her. He seemed embarrassed\\nand tried to excuse himself. “Humans is humans, miss, and sheep is\\nsheep. It makes an old chap, made in Gawd’s h’image, kind o’ bitter\\nto ’ave to spend his days a-scampering after a crowd o’ silly\\nquadrupeds. But if yer don’t like it, I won’t do it.”\\n\\nThe river wound round about us. Sometimes it would leave us, but always\\nit came flowing after us, in great circles as though lonely and eager\\nfor our company. On its banks stood occasional taverns, gaily painted,\\nwith wooden tables set before them. The grass about them was trodden\\nbare, showing that they were often populous; but now they were deserted.\\nBig barges lay sleepily at anchor, basking in the sun.\\n\\nThe drover commenced speaking again. “I’m an old soldier, I am. I\\nlost me eye and got lamed in the wars; and now they makes game o’ my\\nh’infirmities and calls me----”\\n\\nThe name they called him was evidently too dreadful. He sighed heavily.\\n\\n“Poor man,” said Ruthita, slipping her hand into his horny palm. “What\\ndo they call you?”\\n\\n“Old-Dot-and-Carry-One, ’cause o’ the way I walks. It’s woundin’. It\\n’urts me feelin’s, after the way I’ve served me country.”\\n\\nWe seated ourselves by the muddy river-bank, while the sheep grazed and\\nrested. Far in the distance trees broke the level of the sky-line, so I\\nknew that we were going in the right direction and our guide was to be\\ntrusted. Dot-and-Carry-One produced a loaf of bread from his pocket and,\\ndividing it into three pieces, shared it with us.\\n\\nLittle by little he gave us his confidence, telling us of the world\\nas he knew it. “It’s a place o’ wimen and war. To the h’eye wot’s\\nprejoodiced there’s nothin’ else in it. But your h’eye ain’t\\nprejoodiced, and don’t yer never let it git so, young miss and master.\\nI’ve seen lots. I wuz in the Crimea and I wuz in h’India, but I never\\nyet seen the country where a man can’t be ’appy if he wants.\\nThere’s music, an’ there’s nature, an’ there’s marriage. Now music for\\nh’instance.”\\n\\nHe produced from his ragged coat a penny whistle and trilled out a tune\\nupon it. While he played he looked as merry a fellow as one could hope\\nto meet in a day’s march. The sheep stopped cropping to gaze at us. We\\nclapped our hands and asked him to go on.\\n\\nHe shook his head and replaced his pipe. “Then there’s nature. Just now\\nI wuz complainin’. But supposin’ I do drive sheep back and forth, how\\nmany men wuz up in Lun’non to see the sunrise this mornin’? I never\\nmiss it, ’ceptin’ when I’m drunk. I knows the seasons o’ the bloomin’\\nflowers, Gawd bless ’em, and can h’imitate the birds’ songs and call\\n’em to me. That’s somethin’. An’ if I don’t sleep in a stuffy bed, which\\nwould be better, for me rheumatics, I can count the stars and have the\\ngrass for coverin’. And then there’s marriage----”\\n\\nHe paused. His eye became moist and his face gentle. “I ’ad a little\\nnipper and a girl once.”\\n\\nThat was all. We wanted to ask him questions about marriage, but he\\npulled his hat down over his eyes and lay back, refusing to answer.\\n\\nRuthita and I guarded the sheep and kept them from straying, while he\\nslept. We made chains out of flowers, and, taking off our shoes and\\nsocks, paddled in the water. Then Ruthita grew tired and, leaning\\nagainst my shoulder, persuaded me to tell her the story of where we were\\ngoing. Before the tale was ended, her eyes were closed and her lips were\\nparted. My arms began to ache terribly; I wondered whether it was with\\nholding her or because I was growing. I hoped it was because I was\\ngrowing.\\n\\nDot-and-Carry-One woke up. He looked at the sun. “Time we wuz h’orf,” he\\nremarked shortly.\\n\\nWe had not gone far along the river-bank when we came to a tavern on our\\nside of the water. Ruthita said that she was thirsty, so we entered.\\nThe drover spread himself out on a bench and, soliciting my invitation,\\ncalled for “a pint of strong.” Good beer, he said, never hurt any man if\\ntaken in moderation.\\n\\nWe must have sat for the best part of the morning, watching him toss off\\npot after pot while we gritted our feet on the sanded floor. For each\\npot he thanked us, taking off his battered hat to Ruthita and blowing\\naway the froth from the top in our honor. He explained to all and sundry\\nthat we wuz his little nipper and girl wot he had losht. He losht us\\nyears ago, so long he could hardly remember. The tavern-girl entered\\ninto a discussion with him, saying that we could not be more than nine\\nand that he was at least seventy. He became angry, demanding whether a\\nman of seventy hadn’t lived long enough to know his own children, and\\nwhat bloody indifference it made to her, anyway.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that it might be just possible that he really was\\nRuthita’s father. I had no idea what dying meant. I had been told that\\nthe dead were not really dead--only gone. So I thought that death might\\nmean not being with your friends in the garden. I half expected to find\\nmy mother in the forest, just as I had hoped to bring her back on the\\nmagic carpet. So when Dot-and-Carry-One was so positive, I asked him if\\nhe had heard of the Siege of Paris. He was in a mood when he had heard\\nof everything, been everywhere, and had had every important person for a\\nfriend. Of course he had heard of the Siege of Paris; if it hadn’t been\\nfor him, to-day there wouldn’t be any Paris. When I told him of General\\nFavart, he wept copiously and called for another pot.\\n\\nThe tavern-girl told him that that must be his last, and he said that it\\nwas cruel ’ard the way an old soldier were persecooted. When we had\\npaid for his drinks, we discovered that we had only three shillings and\\neightpence left of our little stock of money. The tavern-girl said we\\nwere poor h’innercent lambs and she should set the police on him. The\\ndrover told her that spring, not autumn, was the lambing season.\\n\\nAll through the long and drowsy afternoon we wandered on.\\nDot-and-Carry-One seemed in no great hurry to reach his destination.\\nBeer had had a transfiguring effect upon him. He lurched along jauntily,\\nhis hat cocked sideways on his head, winking with his one good eye at\\nany girls we met in our path. His cares and sense of injustice were\\nforgotten. He told us tales of his wars, painting tremendous and bloody\\nscenes of carnage. He slew whole armies that afternoon, and at the end\\nof each battle he was left alone, wounded but dauntless, with the dead\\n’uns piled high about him. He went into grisly details of the manner\\nof their dying, and stopped now and then to show us with his stick\\nthe different ways in which you could kill a man with a sword. Cockney\\nlovers on the river gaped after us, resting on their oars. They saw\\nnothing but an intoxicated old ruffian in charge of a flock of sheep and\\ntwo small children. But we were in hero-land, and Dot-and-Carry-One was\\nour giant-killer.\\n\\nWhen Ruthita got tired, he hoisted her on to his shoulders, where she\\nrode straddling his neck, with her hands clasped about his forehead.\\nThe forest, like a green silent army, with its flags unfurled marched\\nnearer. The sun sank lower behind us; our long lean shadows ran on\\nbefore us till they lay across the backs of the sheep.\\n\\nWe left the marshes and entered on a white dusty road. Carriages and\\ncoaches and wagons kept passing, which made the sheep bewildered. They\\nkept turning this way and that, bleating pitifully. Ruthita had to walk\\nagain, while Dot-and-Carry-One barked and waved his stick to keep the\\nflock from scattering. The night came on and we were hungry. At last\\nRuthita’s legs gave out and she sat down by the roadside crying, saying\\nthat she was frightened and could go no further. Then Dot-and-Carry-One\\ndrove his flock into the forest, and borrowed a shilling from me and\\nleft us, promising to go and buy food with it.\\n\\nThe sheep lay down about the roots of the trees, and we pillowed our\\nheads against their woolly backs. The silence became intense; the last\\nof the twilight vanished. I was glad when Ruthita put her arms round my\\nneck, for I too was nervous though I would not own it. We waited for the\\ndrover to return, and in waiting slept.\\n\\nI woke with a start. The moon was shining; long paths of silver had been\\nhewn between the trees. The fleece of the kneeling sheep was sparkling\\nand dewy. Far down one of the paths I could see a limping figure\\napproaching. He was shouting and singing and stabbing at his shadow. As\\nhe came nearer I could distinctly see that he held a bottle in his hand.\\nSomething warned me. I roused Ruthita, telling her to make no sound. We\\nran till we were breathless and the shouting could be no more heard.\\n\\nTrees grew wider apart where we had halted. Far away a flare of\\nlight shone up; as we watched we saw that people passed before it.\\nHand-in-hand we advanced. Something groaned quite near us. We commenced\\nto run, but, looking back, saw that it was only a tethered donkey. We\\ncame to the outskirts of the crowd. We wanted company badly. Burrowing\\nunder arms and legs we made our way to the front. A great linen sheet\\nwas stretched between two trees. Set up on iron rings before it was a\\nline of cocoanuts. On either side flaring naphtha-lamps were burning.\\nAbout thirty yards away from the sheet a woman was serving out wooden\\nballs. Between the sheet and the cocoanuts a man was darting up and\\ndown, dodging the balls as they were thrown and returning them. The man\\nand woman were calling out together, “Two shies a penny. Two shies a\\npenny. Every ball ’its a cocoanut. Down she goes. ’Ere you are, sir.\\nTwo for the children and one for the missis. Walk up. Walk up. Two shies\\na penny.”\\n\\nWhether a cocoanut went down or stayed up, they continued to assert in\\na hoarse, cracked monotone that it had fallen. Their faces were dripping\\nwith perspiration. The man returned the balls and the woman served them\\nout again mechanically. The throwers took off their coats and hurled\\nfuriously, to the accompaniment of the shrill staccato chatter of the\\ncrowd.\\n\\nRuthita and I stood blinking in the semi-darkness, our eyes dazzled\\nby the lamps. Suddenly I called out, and pushing my way between the\\nthrowers, commenced running up the pitch. The man behind the cocoanuts,\\nrealizing that the balls had ceased coming, stopped dodging and looked\\nup to see what was the matter. Just then an impatient thrower hurled a\\nball which went whizzing over me, missed the cocoanuts, and hit the man\\non the head, splitting his eyebrow. I was terribly afraid that he would\\ntopple over and lie still, like Dot-and-Carry-One had told me men did in\\nbattle. Instead of that, when I came within reach of him he clutched me\\nangrily by the shoulder, asking me what the devil I meant. The blood,\\ncreeping down his face in a slow trickle, made him look twice as fierce\\nas when I had first met him with my Uncle Obad by the gipsy campfire. He\\ndrew me near to one of the lamps, smearing his forehead with the back of\\nhis hand. He recognized me.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s you, you young cuss, is it?”\\n\\nJust then the fortune-telling girl came up, whom I had seen before with\\nthe baby on her back. She was carrying Ruthita.\\n\\n“Here, Lilith,” he said, speaking gruffly, “take ’im to your tent.”\\n\\nThen he commenced again, “Two shies a penny. Two shies a penny. Every\\nball ’its a cocoanut. Down she goes,” etc.\\n\\nI was glad to creep into the cool darkness, clinging close to Lilith’s\\nskirt. I was a little boy now, with scarcely a desire to be a husband.\\nWhen I looked across my shoulder the game was in full swing. The woman\\nwas serving out the balls; the crowd was paying its pennies; the man was\\ndodging up and down before the sheet, avoiding the balls and returning\\nthem. I heaved a sigh of relief; then he had not succumbed--he was not\\nyet a dead’un.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII--THE OPEN WORLD\\n\\nThat night in the tent I slept soundly, with the fortuneteller’s arm\\nabout me and my head nearly touching Ruthita’s across her breast. The\\nsoft rise and fall of her bosom made me dream of my mother.\\n\\nGlimmerings of the early autumn sunrise crept in through holes in the\\ncanvas. I raised myself cautiously and gazed at the woman who had cared\\nfor me. I call her a woman, for she seemed to me a woman then; she\\nwas about seventeen--little more than a girl. Her face was gentle and\\npassionate; her jet black hair streamed down in a torrent across\\nher tawny throat and breast. She smiled in her sleep and murmured to\\nherself; the arm which clasped Ruthita kept twitching, as though to draw\\nher nearer. While I watched, her eyes opened; she said nothing, but lay\\nsmiling up at me. Presently she put her free arm about my neck, and drew\\nme down so my cheek rested against hers. She turned her head and I saw\\nthat, though she looked happy, there were tears on her long dark lashes.\\nHer lips moved and I knew what she wanted. Putting my arms about her, I\\nkissed her good-morning.\\n\\nRousing Ruthita, she raised the flap of the tent and we slipped out.\\nMists were drifting across the woodland, pink and golden where the\\nsunrise caught them, but lavender in the shadows. It was a quiet fairy\\nworld, like the face of a sleeping woman, which was pale with dew upon\\nthe forehead and copper and bronze with the streaming hair of faded\\nfoliage. Outside the door the grass was blackened in a circle where\\na gipsy fire had burnt. The yellow caravan stood near. In and out the\\nbracken rabbits were hopping, nibbling at the cool green turf. The\\ngipsy’s lurcher watched them, crouched with his nose between his paws,\\nwaiting his opportunity to steal closer. Lilith set about gathering\\nbrushwood for the fire and we helped her.\\n\\n“Ruthie, am I taller?”\\n\\nShe eyed me judicially and shook her curls. “No. But p’raps we shall\\ngrow tall quite suddenly, when the honeymoon is ended.”\\n\\nI was beginning to have my doubts of that, so I changed the subject.\\n“Lilith has a baby. She carries it on her back.”\\n\\n“Where does she keep it now?” asked Ruthita. “It wasn’t on her back\\nlast night in the tent.” Then she commenced to hop about like an eager,\\nexcited little bird. “I shall ask her. I shall ask her, Dante, and\\nshe’ll let me hold it.”\\n\\nBut when we ran to Lilith her back was straight and unbulgy. And when we\\nasked her where she kept the baby, she dropped the bundle of sticks she\\nwas carrying and sank to her knees, with her hands pressed against her\\nbreast. She swayed to and fro, with her eyes closed, muttering in a\\nstrange language. Then she bent forward, kissing the ground and chanting\\nwords which sounded like, “Coroon! Coroon! Oh, dearie, come back. Come\\nback!”\\n\\nWe heard the door of the caravan open. Lilith sprang to her feet and\\npicked up her sticks as though ashamed of what she had been doing. The\\nfierce man stood on the caravan steps. He strode across the grass to\\nLilith and laid his hand on her shoulder with a rough gesture which was\\nalmost kindly. “The wind blows, sister,” he said, “and it sinks behind\\nthe moon. The flowers grow, sister, and they fall beneath the earth.\\nWhere they have gone there is rest.”\\n\\nHe passed on, whistling to his lurcher. The gaudily dressed woman came\\nout; while he was gone, the fire was kindled and breakfast was prepared.\\n\\nDuring breakfast a great discussion arose in their strange language.\\nWhen it was ended, Lilith took us with her into the tent. She closed\\nthe flap carefully and began to undress us. While she was doing it she\\nexplained matters. She told us that the man was too busy just now with\\nthe cocoanut-shies to spare time to go and fetch my uncle to us. In a\\nfew days he would go, but meanwhile we must stay with them in camp. She\\nsaid that they were good gipsies, but no one would believe it if they\\nsaw us with them. They would have to make us like gipsy children so\\nno one would suspect. So she daubed our bodies all over a light brown\\ncolor, and she stained my hair because it was flaxen. Then she gave us\\nragged clothes, without shoes or stockings, and dug a hole in the ground\\nand hid ours. She was curious to know what had brought us to the\\nforest; but we would not tell. We had the child’s feeling that telling\\na grown-up would break the spell--we should never be married then, the\\nlittle house would never be built, and none of the other pleasant things\\nwould happen. We should have to go back to the garden again and live\\nalways within walls.\\n\\nThose days spent in our first dash for freedom stand out in my memory as\\namong the happiest. I ate of the forbidden fruit of romance and reaped\\nno penalties. Ruthita cried at times for her mother; but I had only to\\nremind her of the babies she would have, and her courage returned.\\n\\nThe smell of the camp-fire is in my nostrils as I write; I can feel\\nagain the cool nakedness of unpaved woodlands beneath my feet and open\\nskies above my head. I see Ruthita unsubdued and bare-legged, plunging\\nshoulder-high into golden bracken, shouting with natural gladness,\\nfollowed by the gipsy boys and girls. We tasted life in its fullness for\\nthe first time, she and I, on that fantastic honeymoon of ours. We felt\\nin our bones and flesh the simple ecstasy of being alive--the wide,\\nsweet cleanness of the open world. And remembering, I wonder now, as\\nI wondered then, why men have toiled to learn everything except to be\\nhappy, and have labored with so much heaviness to build cities when the\\ntent and the camp-fire might be theirs.\\n\\nBooks, schoolmasters, and universities have taught me much since then.\\nThey have spattered the windows of my soul with knowledge to prevent my\\nlooking out. Luckily I discovered what they were doing and stopped the\\nrascals. But I knew more things that were essentially godlike before\\nthey commenced their work. The major part of what they taught me was a\\nweariness to the flesh in the learning, and a burden to the brain when\\nlearnt. Of how many days of shouting and sunshine they robbed me with\\ntheir mistaken kindness. Of what worth is a Euclid problem at forty,\\nwhen compared with the memory of a childhood’s day of flowers, and\\nmeadows, and happiness?\\n\\nFor twenty years my father sat prisoner at a desk, unbeautifully and\\ndoggedly driving his pen across countless pages that he might be able to\\nbuy me wisdom. With all his years of sacrifice and my years of laborious\\nstudy, he gave me nothing which was half so valuable as that which a boy\\nof nine stole for himself in his ignorance in the forest. There I learnt\\nthat the sound of wind in trees is the finest music in the world; that\\nthe power to feel in one’s own body the wholesome beauties of nature is\\nmore rewarding than wealth; that to know how to abandon oneself to\\nthe simple kindness of living people is a wiser knowledge than all the\\nelaborate and codified wisdom of the dead.\\n\\nWe roamed the countryside with Lilith by day, listening to her telling\\nfortunes. By night we slept in her arms in the tent. Only one thing\\nwas forbidden us--to speak with strangers. But there was one man who\\nrecognized us in spite of that. It was on the first morning. We were\\nsitting by the side of the road with the fierce man; he was showing us\\nhow to make a snare for a rabbit. We were so interested that we did not\\nnotice a flock of sheep approaching until they were quite close. Then\\nI looked up and caught the eye of old Dot-and-Carry One burning in his\\nhead, glaring out at us as if it would fly from its socket. He would\\nhave spoken had he dared, but just then the fierce man saw him. He sank\\nhis chin upon his breast and, for all that he was “a human, made in\\nGawd’s h’image,” limped away into the distance in a cloud of dust, as\\nmeekly sheepish as any of the sheep he followed.\\n\\nRuthita spent a lot of her time in searching for Lilith’s baby. She\\nwanted so badly to hold it. We felt quite certain that she had hidden\\nit somewhere, as she had our clothes. Even if it was a dead’un, it was\\nabsurd to suppose that a person so clever as to tell fortunes should\\nnot know where it might be found. We determined to watch her. We thought\\nthat if her baby was really dead and she went to it by stealth, then\\nby following her we should be able to find my mother and, perhaps,\\nRuthita’s father. Ruthita had already abandoned the dread that\\nDot-and-Carry-One had had anything to do with her entrance into the\\nworld.\\n\\nNaphtha-lamps were extinguished. The crowd of merrymakers had departed.\\nI was roused by Lilith stirring. Very gently she eased her arm\\nfrom under me. I kept my eyes tightly shut and feigned that I was\\nundisturbed. Cautiously she pulled aside the flap of the tent and stole\\nout. I rose to my feet when she had gone. Ruthita was sleeping soundly,\\nher small face cushioned in her hand. Without waking her I followed.\\n\\nNear to the caravan the camp-fire smoldered, making a splash of red\\nlike a pool of blood in the blackness. As I watched, it was momentarily\\nblotted out by a moving shadow. The lurcher shook himself and growled.\\nLilith’s voice reached me, telling him to lie down. A bank of cloud lay\\nacross the moon, but I knew the way she went by the rustle of the fallen\\nleaves, turning beneath her tread. I followed her down the glades of the\\nforest, peering after her, glancing behind me at the slightest sound,\\ntimid lest I might lose her, timid lest I might lose myself, stealing on\\ntiptoe into the unknown with sobbing, stifled breath. The ground began\\nto descend into a hollow at the bottom of which a pond lay black and\\nsullen. A tall beech stood at its edge, spreading out its branches and\\nleaning across it as if to hide it. The leaves beneath her footsteps\\nceased to stir.\\n\\nWhen I could no longer hear her, a horrible, choking sense of solitude\\ntook hold of me. What if she had entered into the tree and should never\\nreturn? Without her, how should I find my way back? I crept as near\\nthe pond as I dared, and crouched among the dead leaves, trembling.\\nThe water began to splash. “Someone,” I thought, “is rising out of it.”\\n Little waves, washing in the rushes, caused the brittle reeds to shake\\nand shiver, whispering in terror among themselves. A low sing-song\\nmuttering commenced. It came from the middle of the pond. I tried to\\nstop breathing. It seemed quite possible that the baby was hidden there.\\n\\nThe bank of cloud trailed across the sky. The yellow harvest moon\\ndipped, broad and smiling, into the latticework of boughs which roofed\\nthe dell.\\n\\nIn the middle of the pond, knee-deep, Lilith stood. She had cast aside\\nher Romany rags and rose from the water tall and splendid. Her tawny\\nbody was a gold statue glistening beneath the moon. Her night-black\\nhair fell sheer from her shoulders like a silken shadow. She was bending\\nforward, peering eagerly beneath the water’s surface, whispering hurried\\nlove-words. Of all that she said I could only catch the words, “Coroon.\\nCoroon. Come back, little dearest. Come back.” She laughed gladly and\\nheld out her arms, as though there drifted up towards her that which she\\nsought. I could see nothing, for her back was towards me. Still lower\\nshe bent till her lips kissed the water’s surface; plunging her arms in\\nelbow-deep, she seemed to support the thing which she saw there.\\n\\n“Lilith, oh Lilith!” I cried.\\n\\nShe started and turned. I feared she was going to be angry. “Show me my\\nMama,” I whispered.\\n\\nShe put her finger to her lips, and beckoned, and nodded.\\n\\nHastily I undressed, tossing my rags beside hers. I waded out to where\\nshe was standing. The night air was chilly. She gave me her hand and\\ndrew me to her. Placing me before her, so that I could gaze into the\\npond like a mirror, she chanted over and over a low, wild tune. She\\npeered above my shoulders. At first I could see only my own reflection\\nand hers. Then, as she sang, the water moved, the inky blackness\\nreddened; I forgot everything, the cold, Lilith, my terror, and lived\\nonly in that which was coming.\\n\\nIn the bottom of the pool, infinitely distant, a picture grew. It came\\nso near that I thought it would touch me; I became a part of it. I saw\\nmy mother. She was seated by a fire in an unlighted room. A little boy\\nlay in her lap with his arms about her. She glanced up at me smiling\\nfaintly, gazing into my eyes directly. For a moment I saw her\\ndistinctly, and caught again the fragrance of violets that clung about\\nher. The water rippled and the vision died away in smoke and cloud.\\nLilith gathered me to her cold wet breast and carried me to the shore\\nand dressed me. Without knowing why, I knew that this was a happening\\nthat I must not tell.\\n\\nWe returned to camp. Woods were stirring. Shadows were thinning. Dawn\\nwas breaking. The coldness in the air became intense. We threw branches\\non the fire and blew the smoldering embers, till sparks began to fly\\nand twigs to crackle. Lilith sat with me in her arms, and hushed and\\nmothered me. I was not ashamed; for five years I had wanted just that.\\nI was glad that she understood. Ruthita could not see me; nobody but the\\ndawn would ever know. So I fell asleep and went back to the fragrance of\\nviolets, the fire, and the cosy darkened room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII--RECAPTURED\\n\\nRuthita and I were terribly puzzled about that baby. We couldn’t make\\nout how it had found its way into the world. We supposed that God had\\nmade a mistake in sending it to Lilith, and that was why He had taken it\\nback.\\n\\nOur difficulty rose from the fact that Lilith did not appear ever to\\nhave been married. The fierce man was not her husband. So far as we\\ncould discover from the gipsy children she had never had a husband.\\nThen she couldn’t have had a honeymoon: and, if she had never had a\\nhoneymoon, she oughtn’t to have had a baby. Our ideas on the question of\\nbirth were utterly disorganized. There was only one explanation--that\\nwe had been misinformed by Hetty and people could have babies\\nby themselves. The effect of this conjecture on Ruthita was\\nrevolutionizing: it made our honeymoon unnecessary and me entirely\\ndispensable. She had only been persuaded to elope for the sake of\\nexchanging dolls for babies, and now it appeared she could have them\\nand her mother as well. I had no argument left with which to combat her\\ndesire to return. There was only one way of arriving at the truth on the\\nsubject, and that was by inquiring of Lilith. Neither of us would have\\ndone this for worlds after the way she had cried when we found that her\\nback was no longer bulgy.\\n\\nThe days grew shorter and the forest became bare. We could see long\\ndistances now between the tree-trunks; it was as though the branches had\\nfisted their hands. Holiday-seekers came to the cocoanut-shies less and\\nless. The fierce man, whom we learnt to call G’liath, had hardly any\\nbruises on his face and hands; he dodged the balls easily. The few\\nchance throwers had no crowd to make them reckless; they shied singly\\nnow and not in showers. The gaudily dressed woman lost her hoarseness.\\nShe no longer had to shout night and morning, “Two shies a penny. Two\\nshies a penny. Every ball ’its a cocoanut. Down she goes,” etc. Why\\nshould she? There was no one to get excited--nobody to pay her pennies.\\nInstead she sat by the fire, weaving wicker-baskets, watching the\\npearl- smoke go up in whiffs and eddies. Though she seldom said\\nanything, she had taken a fancy to Ruthita and would spread for her a\\ncorner of her skirt that she might sit beside her while she worked.\\n\\nEvery day as Ruthita became more sure that she could have a baby all by\\nherself, she wanted to go home more badly. One evening the gaudy woman\\nfound her crying. She told G’liath that next morning he must harness in\\nhis little moke and go for Mr. Spreckles. I did not hear her tell him,\\nbut Lilith told me when she came to lie down beside me in the tent.\\n\\nThat night she held me closer. I could feel her heart thumping. She\\nroused me continually in the darkness to ask me needless questions.\\nWhether I would ever forget her. “No.” Whether I would like to see her\\nagain. “Yes.” Whether I would like to become a gipsy. “Wouldn’t I!”\\n\\nShe was silent for so long that I began to drowse. I awoke with the\\ntightening of her arms about me. When I lifted my face to hers, she\\ncommenced to kiss me passionately. “You shall. You shall,” she said.\\n“I’ll make a gipsy of you, so you’ll always remember and never be\\ncontent with their closed-in world. They’ll take you from me to-morrow,\\nbut your heart will never be theirs.”\\n\\nI didn’t understand, but at dawn she showed me. Frost lay on the ground.\\nEvery little blade of grass was stiff and sword-like. It was as though\\nthe hair of the world had turned white from shock and was standing on\\nend.\\n\\nShe led me away through the tall stark forest to a glade so secret that\\nno one could observe us. At first I thought she was escaping with me,\\ncarrying me off to her gipsy-land. But she made me kneel down beside\\nher. As the sun wheeled above the cold horizon she snatched a little\\nknife from beneath her dress, and pricked her wrist and mine so that\\nthey bled. She held her hand beneath our wrists, catching the blood in\\nher palm so it mingled. Then she let it drip through her fingers, making\\nscarlet stains on the frosted turf.\\n\\nAs it fell she spoke to the grass and the trees and the air, telling\\nthem that I was hers and, because our blood was mingled, was one of\\nthem. “Whenever he hears your voice,” she said, “it will speak to him\\nof me. If he goes where you do not grow, oh grass, then the trees shall\\ncall him back. If he goes where you do not grow, oh trees, then the wind\\nshall tell him. His hand shall be as ours, against the works of men.\\nWhen he hears your voice, oh grass, or your voice, oh trees, or your\\nvoice, oh winds, he shall turn his face from walls and come back. Though\\nhe leaves us he shall always hear us calling, for he is ours!”\\n\\nAnd it seemed to me when her voice had ceased that I heard the grass\\nnodding its head. From the dawn came a breath of wind, sweeping through\\nthe trees, stooping their leafless branches as though they gave assent.\\n\\nThat morning for the first time we had breakfast in the caravan. After\\nbreakfast Lilith and I went out together, hand-in-hand. G’liath was\\nharnessing in his donkey. We watched him drive down the road and vanish.\\nI did not want to go back and he knew it; he looked ashamed of\\nhimself. The country was bitter and cheerless; it had an atmosphere of\\nparting--everything was withered. Birds huddled close on branches with\\nruffled feathers. Fields were harsh and cracked.\\n\\n“Little brother,” Lilith said, “one day you will be a man. Until then\\nthey will keep you prisoner and try to make you forget all the things\\nwhich you and I have learnt. They will tell you that the trees have no\\nvoices: that it is only the wind that stirs them. They will tell you\\nthat rivers are only water flowing. But remember that out in the open\\nthey are all waiting for you, and that the other people who have no\\nbodies are there.”\\n\\nI thought of the picture I had seen in the pool and knew what she meant.\\n\\nTowards evening we returned to the camp. The melancholy autumn twilight\\nlay about us; in the heart of it the fire burnt red. We sat round it in\\nsilence, watching the hard white road through the trees and listening\\nfor G’liath coming back. “Ruthita,” I whispered, “do you think we shall\\nfind the little house?”\\n\\nShe shook her head doubtfully, as if she scarcely cared. She was\\nthinking of the lighted room, perhaps, and the long white bed, where her\\nmother was eagerly awaiting her.\\n\\nComing up the road we heard a sharp tap-a-tap. Dancing in and out the\\ntree-trunks we saw the golden eyes of carriage-lamps. The dog-cart and\\nDollie came into sight and halted; my Uncle Obad jumped out. He had come\\nalone to fetch us; I was glad of that. I could explain things to him\\nso much more easily than to my father, and he was sure to understand.\\nCatching sight of me by the fire, he ran forward and lifted me up in his\\narms. All he could say was, “Well, well, well!” His face was beaming;\\nevery little wrinkle in his face was trembling. He hugged me so tightly\\nthat he took away my breath. I didn’t get a chance to speak until he had\\nset me down. Then I said, “Uncle Obad, this is Ruthita.”\\n\\nHe held out his hand to her gravely. “I’m pleased to meet you, Mrs.\\nDante Cardover,” he said. Then, because she was such a little girl and\\nher face looked so thin and wistful, he took her in his arms and hugged\\nher as well.\\n\\nSuddenly the gaudy woman remembered that we were still clothed in our\\ngipsy rags. She wanted to take us into the caravan and dress us, but\\nUncle Obad wouldn’t hear of it. He insisted on carrying us off to Pope\\nLane just as we were.\\n\\nIt was night when he said, “Dollie is rested; we must be going.” When we\\nrose to our feet to say good-by, Lilith was not there. He lifted us into\\nthe dog-cart and wrapped rugs about our shoulders to make us cozy. Then\\nhe jumped in beside us and we had our last look at the camp. The gaudy\\nwoman was standing up by the fire with her children huddled about her\\nskirts. I could see the gleam of her ear-rings shaking, the lighted\\nwindow of the caravan in the background, and the lurcher sneaking in and\\nout the shadows. G’liath and his donkey travelled slowly; they had not\\nreturned when we left. Uncle Obad cracked his whip; we started forward\\nacross the turf and were soon bowling between the dim skeletons of trees\\ndown the hard road homeward.\\n\\nRuthita crept closer to me. She may have been cold and she may have been\\nlonely, but I think she was just feeling how flat things were now\\nour great adventure was over. She had feared it while it lasted; now,\\nwomanlike, she was wishing that it was not quite ended. Every now and\\nthen she drew her fingers across my face--a little love-trick she had.\\nShe leant her head against my shoulder and was soon sleeping soundly.\\n\\n“Old chap, why did you do it?”\\n\\nI looked up at my uncle; I could not see his face because of the\\ndarkness. His voice was very solemn and kindly.\\n\\n“We couldn’t see anything in the garden,” I said; “we wanted to find\\nwhere the pigeons went.”\\n\\n“But why did you take the little girl?”\\n\\nI hesitated about telling. It might spoil what was left of the magic;\\nI still had a faint hope that by the time we reached Pope Lane I might\\nhave grown into a man. And then, in telling, I might do Hetty a damage.\\nInstead of answering, I asked him a question.\\n\\n“When you’re married, you get everything you want, don’t you?”\\n\\n“That depends on what you call everything, Dante.”\\n\\n“Well, money, and a house, and a pony, and babies.”\\n\\n“Not always.”\\n\\nHe spoke softly. Then I knew I oughtn’t to have mentioned babies,\\nbecause, like Lilith, he hadn’t any.\\n\\n“It wasn’t I who wanted the babies,” I explained hurriedly; “that was\\nRuthie. She wanted them instead of dolls to play with. I wanted to be\\nallowed to go in and out, like the children with the magic carpet.”\\n\\nHe knew at once what I meant. “You didn’t want to have grown people\\nalways bothering, telling you to do this and not to do that, and locking\\ndoors behind you? You wanted always to be free and jolly, like you and\\nI are together? And you thought that you could be like that if you were\\nmarried?”\\n\\nHe slowed Dollie down to a walk.\\n\\n“Little man, you’ve been trying to get just what everyone’s reaching\\nafter. When you’re a boy you say, ‘I’ll have it when I’m a man.’ When\\nyou’re a man you say, ‘I’ll have it when I’m married.’ You’ve been\\nsearching for perpetual happiness. You’ll never have it in this world,\\nDante. And don’t you see why you’ll never have it? You hurt other people\\nin trying to get it. Your father and Ruthita’s mother, all of us have\\nbeen very anxious. I’ve often been tempted to run away myself because\\nI’m not much use to anybody. But that would mean leaving someone I love;\\nso I’ve had to stop on and face it out. You ran away to enjoy yourself,\\nand other people were sorry. Other people always have to be sorry when a\\nfellow does that.”\\n\\nHe shook the reins over Dollie and she commenced to trot again.\\nPresently he said, half-speaking to himself, “There’s a better word than\\nhappiness, and that’s duty. If a chap does his duty the best he can, he\\nmakes other folk happy. Then he finds his own happiness by accident,\\nwithin himself. I’m a queer one to be talking--I’m not awfully\\nsuccessful. I’ve run away a little. But you must do better. And if you\\ncan’t bear things, just _imagine_. What’s the difference between the\\nthings you really have and the things you pretend? Imagination is the\\nmagic carpet; you can pretend yourself anything and anywhere. If you’ve\\nlearnt that secret, they can lock all the doors--it won’t matter. I\\ncan’t put it plainer; there are things that it isn’t right for you to\\nunderstand--this business about marriage. You’ll know when you’re a man.\\nNow promise that you’ll never run away again.”\\n\\nI promised.\\n\\nWhen we got to Pope Lane it must have been very late. I suppose I fell\\nasleep on the journey, for I remember nothing more until the light\\nflashed in my eyes and my father was bending over me. Ruthita wasn’t\\nthere; she had been left already at her mother’s house. My father had me\\nin his arms. He was standing in the hall. The door was wide open and my\\nuncle was going down the steps, calling “Good-night” as he went. Behind\\nme I could see Hetty peering over the banisters in a gray flannel\\nnightdress--her night-dresses were all of gray flannel. When my father\\nturned, she scuttled away like a frightened rabbit.\\n\\nHe carried me into his study--just as I was, clad in my gipsy rags--and\\nclosed the door behind him with a slam. His lamp on the table was turned\\nlow. The floor was littered with books and papers. A fire in the hearth\\nwas burning brightly. He drew up an easy-chair to the blaze and sat\\ndown, still holding me to him. I was always timid with my father,\\nespecially when we were alone together. This time I was very conscious\\nof wrong-doing. I waited to hear him say something; but he remained\\nsilent, staring into the fire. The lamp flickered lower and lower, and\\nwent out.\\n\\n“Father, I--I didn’t mean to hurt you.”\\n\\nThen I saw that he was crying. His tears splashed down. His face had\\nlost that stem look. I was shaken by his sobs as he held me.\\n\\n“Little son. My little son,” he whispered.\\n\\nThe room grew fainter. The pictures on the walls became shadowy. My eyes\\nopened and closed. When I awoke the gray light of morning was stealing\\nin at the window. The fire had fallen away in ashes. The air was chilly.\\nMy father was sitting in the easy-chair, his head sunk forward--but his\\narms were still about me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX--THE SNOW LADY\\n\\nMy father never asked me why I had run away or where I had gone.\\nHis tongue was ever stubborn at loving with words. With Hetty it was\\ndifferent. When my father had wakened and let me out of his arms to go\\nupstairs and dress, she caught me into her bosom and half-smothered me,\\nscolding and comforting by turns. Her corsets hurt me and her starched\\nprint-dress was harsh; I was glad when she left off and set me down on\\nthe bed.\\n\\n“And who ever ’eard the likes o’ that,” she said: “a little boy to run\\naway from his dear Pa and take with ’im a little sweet-’eart as we\\nnever knew ’e ’ad. Oh, the deceit of children for all they looks so\\nh’innercent! And ’ere was your dear Pa a-tearin’ all the ’air out of\\n’is ’ead. And ’ere was me and John--we couldn’t do no work and\\nwe couldn’t do nothin’ for thinkin’ where you’d went. And there was you\\na-livin’ with those dirty gipsies and wearin’ their dirty rags------”\\n\\n“They’re not dirty,” I interrupted, “and I shan’t like you if you talk\\nlike that.”\\n\\n“Well, I’m only tellin’ you the truth; you was always perwerse and\\n’eadstrong.”\\n\\n“You didn’t tell me the truth when you told me about marriage,” I said.\\n“Everything’s just the same as when we left. We ar’n’t any taller, and\\nwe hav’n’t got a little house, and----”\\n\\nShe sat back on her heels and stared at me. “Oh, Lor,” she burst out,\\n“was that why you did it?” And then she began to laugh and laugh. Her\\nface grew red and again she fell upon me, until her corsets cut into me\\nto such an extent that I called to her to leave off.\\n\\n“What I told you was gorspel true,” she said solemnly, “but you didn’t\\nunderstand. That’s wot ’appens to wimmen when they goes away with men.\\nI wasn’t speakin’ of little boys and girls. But it’ll never ’appen to\\nyou when you grow up if you tell anybody wot I said.”\\n\\nThat morning after breakfast, instead of going into his study to work,\\nmy father led me round to the Favarts’. As we came up the path I saw\\nRuthita at the window watching for us. Monsieur Favart opened the door\\nto our knock. He said something to my father in French, shook me by the\\nhand gravely, and led the way upstairs. We entered a room at the back of\\nthe house, overlooking the garden. A lady, almost as small as Ruthita,\\nwas lying on a couch with cushions piled behind her head. She was\\ndressed completely in white; she had dark eyes and white hair, and a\\nface that somehow surprised you because it was so young and little. From\\nthe first I called her the Snow Lady to myself.\\n\\nShe held out her hand to me and then, instead, put her arm about my\\nwaist, smiling up at me. “So you are Dante, the little boy who wanted to\\nmarry my little girl?”\\n\\nHer voice was more soft and emotional than any voice I had ever heard.\\nIt held me, and kept me from noticing anything but her. It seemed as\\nthough all the eagerness of living, which other people spend in motion,\\nwas stored up in that long white throat of hers and delicate scarlet\\nmouth.\\n\\n“You can’t marry Ruth yet, you know,” she said; “you hav’n’t any money.\\nBut if you like, you may go and kiss her.”\\n\\nShe turned me about and there was Ruthita standing behind me. I did what\\nI was told, shyly and perfunctorily. There was no sense of pleasure in\\ndoing what you were ordered to do just to amuse grown people. The Snow\\nLady laughed gaily. “There, take him out into the garden, Ruthita, and\\nteach him to do it properly.”\\n\\nAs I left the room, I saw that my father had taken my place by the\\ncouch. Monsieur Favart was looking out of the window, his hands folded\\non the head of his cane and his chin resting on them.\\n\\nWe played in the garden together, but much of the charm had gone out of\\nour playing now that it was allowed. The game we played was gipsies in\\nthe forest. We gathered leaves and made a fire, pretending we were\\nagain in camp. I was G’liath; Ruthita was sometimes the gaudy woman and\\nsometimes Lilith telling fortunes. But the pretense was tame after the\\nreality.\\n\\n“Ruthie,” I said, “we ar’n’t married. What Hettie told me was all swank.\\nIt’s only true of men and women, and not of boys and girls.”\\n\\n“But we can grow older.”\\n\\n“Yes. But it’ll take ages.”\\n\\nShe folded her hands in her pinafore nervously.\\n\\n“We can go on loving till then,” she said.\\n\\nOn the way home my father told me that he liked Ruthita--liked her so\\nmuch that he had arranged with Madam Favart to have a door cut in the\\nwall between the two gardens so that we could go in and out. I didn’t\\ntell him that I preferred climbing over; he could scarcely guess it for\\nhimself. There was no excitement in being pushed into the open and told\\nto go and play with Ruthita. It was all too easy. The fun had been in\\nno one knowing that I did play with such a little girl--not even knowing\\nthat there was a Ruthita in the world. We tried to overcome this by\\nalways pretending that we were doing wrong when we were together. We\\nwould hide when we heard anybody coming. I despised the door and only\\nwent through it when a grown person was present, otherwise I entered\\nby way of the apple-tree and the wall. My father caught me at it, and\\ncouldn’t understand why I did it. Hetty said it was because I liked\\nbeing grubby.\\n\\nThrough the gray autumn months I wandered the garden, listening to the\\ndead leaves whispering together. “They’ll take you from me, but your\\nheart will never be theirs,” Lilith had said, and I tried to fancy that\\nthe rustling of leaves was Lilith’s voice calling. It was curious how\\nshe had plucked out my affections and made them hers.\\n\\nOften I would steal into the tool-house and tell the white hen all about\\nit. But she also was a source of disillusionment. After long waiting I\\nfound one egg in her nest. I thought she must be as glad about it as I\\nwas, so left it there a little while for her to look at. I thought the\\nsight of it would spur her on to more ambitious endeavors. But when\\nI came back her beak was yellowy and the egg had vanished. After this\\nunnatural act of cannibalism I told her no more secrets; she had proved\\nherself unworthy. Shortly afterwards she died--perhaps of remorse. I\\nmade my peace with her by placing her in a cardboard shoe-box for a\\ncoffin and giving her a most handsome funeral.\\n\\nOne evening, when I had been put to bed, I stole to the window to gaze\\ninto the blackness. I saw a man with a lantern go across our lawn and\\ndisappear by the apple-tree through the door in the wall. After that I\\nwatched. Nearly every night it happened. I was always too sleepy to\\nstay awake to see at what hour he came back. But I knew that he did come\\nback, for with the first fall of snow I traced his returning\\nfootsteps. They came from Monsieur Favart’s door and entered in at our\\nstudy-window. So I guessed that the man was my father.\\n\\nMadam Favart seemed to be growing stronger; she was able to get up and\\nwalk about. Sometimes I would go into her house for tea, and she would\\nsit by the firelight and tell Ruthita and myself stories. She used\\nto try and get me to climb on her knee while she told them. I always\\nrefused, because my mother used to do that. The Snow Lady used to laugh\\nat me and say, “Ruthita, Dante won’t make love to Mother. Isn’t he\\nsilly?” Then I would grow sulky and sit as far off as I could.\\n\\nWhen Christmas came round, the Favarts were invited over to spend it\\nwith us. The Snow Lady brought a bunch of misletoe with her and hung it\\nabout our house. After dinner the General fell asleep in his chair, and\\nwe children played hide and seek together. I wanted to hide so securely\\nthat Ruthita would never catch me. It was getting dark, and I knew\\nthat she wouldn’t hunt for me in my father’s study. I was a little awed\\nmyself at going there. I pushed open the door. The room was unlighted. I\\nentered, and then halted at the sound of voices whispering. Standing\\nin the window, silhouetted against the snow, were my father and Madam\\nFavart. He was holding a sprig of misletoe over her; his arm was about\\nher, and they were leaning breast to breast. She saw me first and\\nstarted back from him, just as Hetty had done when I found her with\\nJohn. Then my father, turning sharply, saw me. He called to me sternly,\\n“Dante, what are you doing, sir?” He sounded almost afraid because I had\\nbeen watching. Then he called again more softly, “Dante, my boy, come\\nhere.”\\n\\nBut a strange rebellious horror possessed me. It seemed as though\\nsomething were tearing out my heart. I was angry, fiercely angry because\\nhe had been disloyal to my mother. At that moment I hated him, but hated\\nMadam Favart much worse. I knew now why she had told me stories, and why\\nshe had wanted me to climb on her knee, and why she had tried to force\\nme to make love to her. I rushed from the room and down the passage.\\nRuthita ran out laughing to catch me, but I pushed her aside roughly\\nand unjustly. I wanted to get away by myself and fled out into the\\nsnow-covered garden. My father came to the door and called. But Madam\\nFavart was with him; I could see by the gaslight, which fell behind\\nthem, the way she pressed towards him. I could hear her merry contralto\\nlaugh, and refused to answer.\\n\\n“He’ll come by himself,” she said.\\n\\nWhen the door closed and they left me, I felt miserably lonely. They had\\nbeen wicked and they were not sorry. Hetty said that God was twice as\\nangry with you for not being sorry as He was with you for doing wrong.\\nHetty knew everything about God; she used to hold long conversations\\nwith Him every night in her gray flannel nightdress. Soon the snow began\\nto melt into my shoes and the frost to nip my fingers. I wished they\\nwould come out again and call me.\\n\\nI became pathetic over the fact that it was Christmas. I pictured to\\nmyself a possible death as a result of exposure. I saw myself dying in\\na beautiful calm, forgiving everybody, and with everybody kneeling by my\\nbedside shaken with sobbing; the sobs of Madam Favart and my father were\\nto be the loudest. I was to be stretching out long white hands, trying\\nto quiet them; but their sense of guilt was to have placed them beyond\\nall bounds of consolation. Every time I tried to comfort them they were\\nto cry twice as hard. Then I saw my funeral and the big lily wreaths:\\n“From his broken-hearted father”; “From Madam Favart with sincere\\nregrets”; “From Hetty who told God untruths about him”; “From Ruthita\\nwho loved him.” And in the midst of these tokens of grief I lay fully\\nconscious of everything, arrayed in a gray flannel nightshirt, opening\\none eye when no one was looking, and winking at Uncle Obad.\\n\\nI began to feel little pangs of hunger, and my pride gave way before\\nthem. Reluctantly I stole nearer the house and peeked into the\\nstudy. They were all there seated round the fire, callously enjoying\\nthemselves. The secret was plainly out--my father was holding Madam\\nFavart’s hand. Ruthita was cuddled against my father’s shoulder; she was\\nevidently reconciled rather more than stoically. I tapped on the pane.\\nThe old General saw me. He signed to the others to remain still.\\nHe threw up the window and lifted me into the warmth. I believe he\\nunderstood. Perhaps he felt just as I was feeling. At any rate, when\\nit was decreed that I should go to bed at once and drink hot gruel, he\\nslipped a crown-piece into my hand and looked as though he hadn’t done\\nit.\\n\\nWithin a month the marriage was celebrated, my father being a methodical\\nman who hated delays and loved shortcuts. It was a vicarious affair;\\nRuthita and I had taken the honeymoon, and our parents were married. If\\nUncle Obad hadn’t given me the white hen, and the hen hadn’t flown over\\nthe wall, and I hadn’t followed, these things would never have happened.\\n\\nI grew to admire the Snow Lady immensely. She always called me her\\nlittle lover. She never ordered me to do anything or played the mother,\\nbut flirted with me and trusted to my chivalry to recognize her wants.\\nWe played a game of pretending. It had only one disadvantage, that it\\nshut Ruthita out from our game, for one couldn’t court two ladies at\\nonce. I learnt to kiss Ruthita as a habit and to take her, as boys will\\ntheir sisters, for granted. It is only on looking back that I realize\\nhow beautiful and gentle she really was, and what life would have been\\nwithout her.\\n\\nGeneral Favart lived in the other house through the door in the wall.\\nHe came to visit us rarely. He leant more heavily on his cane, and his\\ncloak seemed to have become blacker, his hair whiter, and his scar more\\nprominent. He could scarcely speak a word of English, so I never knew\\nwhat he thought. But it seemed to me he was sorrowing. One day we\\nchildren were told that he was dead; after that the door between the two\\ngardens was taken down and the hole in the wall bricked up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK II--THE PULLING DOWN OF THE WALLS\\n\\n\\n_And man returned to the ground out of which he was taken, and his wife\\nbare children and he builded walls. But thou shalt think an evil thought\\nand say, “I will go up to the land of unwalled villages._”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I--THE RED HOUSE\\n\\n\\nDante, it’s time you went to school.”\\n\\nFor the past three years, since he had married the Snow Lady, my father\\nhad given me lessons in his study for the last hour of every morning\\nbefore lunch. It had been the Snow Lady’s idea; she said I was growing\\nup a perfect ignoramus.\\n\\nMy father tilted up his spectacles to his forehead, and gazed across\\nthe table at me thoughtfully. “Yes,” he repeated, “I’ll be sorry to lose\\nyou, my boy; but it’s time you went to school.”\\n\\nHe was to lose me; then I was to go away! My heart sank, and leapt, and\\nsank again with a dreadful joy of expectation. In my childish way I had\\nalways been impatient of the present--a Columbus ceaselessly watching\\nfor the first trace of seaweed broken loose from the shores of the\\nunknown. Change, which at mid-life we so bitterly resent, was at that\\ntime life’s great allurement.\\n\\nThe school selected was one of the smaller public-schools, lying fifteen\\nmiles distant from Stoke Newington. It was called the Red House and\\nstood on Eden Hill. It was situated in lovely country, so my father\\nsaid, and had for its head-master a man with whom he was slightly\\nacquainted, whose name was the Reverend Robert Sneard.\\n\\nFor the next few weeks I was a semi-hero. Ruthita regarded me with the\\nkind of pitying awe that a bullock inspires in children, when they meet\\nit being driven lowing along a road to be slaughtered. Everyone became\\nbusy over preparations for my departure--even the Snow Lady, who seldom\\nworked. I was allowed to sit up quite late, watching her pretty fingers\\nflashing the needle in and out the flannel that grew into shirts for\\nme to wear. Ruthita would snuggle up beside me, her long black curls\\ntickling my cheek. There were lengthy silences. Then Ruthita would look\\nup at her mother and say, “Mumsie, I don’t know whatever we shall do\\nwithout him.” And sometimes, when she said it, the Snow Lady would laugh\\nin her Frenchy way and answer, “Why, Ruthita, what’s one little boy?\\nHe’s so tiny; he won’t leave much empty space.” But once, it was the\\nnight before I left, she choked in the middle of her laughing and took\\nus both into her arms, telling us that she loved us equally. “I can’t\\nthink what I’ll do without my little lover,” she said.\\n\\nOf a sudden I had become a person of importance. The servants no longer\\nmade a worry of doing things for me. They watched me going about the\\nhouse as though it were for the last time, and spoke of me to one\\nanother as, “Poor little chap.” I had only to express a want to have it\\ngratified. I was treated as the State treats a condemned criminal on the\\nday of his execution, when they let him choose his breakfast. I gloried\\nin my eminence.\\n\\nIt was arranged that my uncle should drive me to the Red House. Before I\\nwent, I was loaded with good advice. My father sent for me to his study\\none night and, with considerable embarrassment, alluded to subjects of\\nwhich I had no knowledge, imploring me to listen to no evil companions\\nbut to keep pure. His language was so delicately veiled that I was none\\nthe wiser. I thought he referred to such boyish peccadilloes as jam\\nstealing and telling lies. Even the Snow Lady, who took delight in being\\nfrivolous, read me a moral story concerning the rapid degeneration,\\nthrough cigarettes and beer-drinking, of a boy with the face of an\\nangel. Neither of these temptations was mine, and I had never regarded\\nmyself as particularly angelic in appearance. They beat about the bush,\\nhunting ghostly passions with allegories.\\n\\nI noticed that Ruthita would absent herself for an hour or more at a\\nstretch. When I followed her up to her room the door was locked, and\\nshe would beseech me with tears in her voice not to peek through the\\nkey-hole. The mystery was explained when she presented me with a knitted\\nmuffler, the wool for which she had purchased from her own savings.\\nI came across it, moth-eaten and faded, in my old school play-box the\\nother day. It was cold weather when she made it, for a little girl to\\nsit in a bedroom without a fire. I hope I thanked her sufficiently and\\ndid not accept her surprise as though it were expected.\\n\\nOn an afternoon in January I departed. Then I realized for the first\\ntime what going away from home meant. The horror of the unknown, not the\\nadventure, pressed upon me. We all pretended to be very gay--all except\\nHetty, who threw her apron over her head and, in the old scripture\\nphrase, lifted up her voice and wept. They accompanied me out of the\\ngarden, down Pope Lane, to where the dog-cart was tethered. I mounted\\nreluctantly, stretching out the last moment to its greatest length, and\\ntook my place beside Uncle Obad. My father had his pen behind his ear,\\nI remember. It seemed to me as though the pen were saying, “Hurry up now\\nand get off. Your father can’t waste all day over little boys.” Dollie\\nlifted her head and began to trot. The Snow Lady waved and waved,\\nsmiling bravely. Then Ruthita broke from the group and ran after us down\\nthe long red street for a little way. We turned a corner and they were\\nlost to sight.\\n\\nI drew nearer to my uncle, pressing Ruthita’s muffler to my lips and\\ngazing straight before me.\\n\\n“What--what’ll it be like?”\\n\\nHe shook his head. “Couldn’t say,” he muttered huskily.\\n\\nAfter about an hour’s driving, he broke the silence with a kindly effort\\nto make conversation. He told me that we were on the Great North Road,\\nwhere there used to be highwaymen. He spoke of Dick Turpin and some of\\nhis exploits. He pointed out a public-house at which highwaymen used to\\nstay. He could not stir my imagination--it was otherwise occupied. I\\nwas wondering why I should be sent to school, if my going made everyone\\nunhappy. I was picturing the snug nursery, with the lamp unlighted, and\\nthe fire burning, and Ruthita seated all alone on the rug before the\\nfire.\\n\\nWe left the Great North Road, striking across country, through frosty\\nlanes. My uncle ceased speaking; he himself was uninterested in what he\\nhad been saying. We passed groups of children playing before clustered\\ncottages, and laborers plodding homeward whistling. It seemed strange to\\nme that they should all be so cheerful and should not realize what was\\nhappening inside me.\\n\\nWe came in sight of the Red House. It could be seen at a great distance,\\nfor it stood out gauntly on the crest of Eden Hill, and the sunset lay\\nbehind it. In the lowlands night was falling; lights were springing\\nup, twinkling cheerfully. But the Red House did not impress me as\\ncheerful--it had no lights, and struck me with the chill and repression\\nthat one feels in passing by a prison.\\n\\n“Well, old chap, we’re nearly there,” said my uncle with a futile\\nattempt to be jolly.\\n\\nI darted out my hand and dragged on the reins. “Don’t--don’t drive so\\nfast. Let Dollie walk.”\\n\\nHe looked down at me slantwise. “You’ve got to be brave, old chap.\\nNothing’s as bad as it seems at the time. Nothing’s so bad that it\\ncan’t be lived through. Why, one day you’ll be looking back and telling\\nyourself that these were your happiest days.”\\n\\nDespite his optimisms, he did as I requested and let Dollie walk the\\nrest of the way. While she climbed the hill, we got out and walked\\nbeside her. My uncle put his hand in his pocket, and drew out a\\nhalf-crown. He balanced it in his palm; tossed it; put it back into his\\npocket; drew it out again. “Here, Dante,” he said at last, “see what\\nI’ve found. You’d best take it.”\\n\\nAs we approached nearer, he was again moved to generosity. He was moved\\nthree times, to be exact; each time he considered the matter carefully,\\nthen rushed the coin at me. He gave me seven shillings in all. I am sure\\nhe could ill afford them.\\n\\nAt the top of the hill he beckoned me to jump into the trap. It was\\nfitting, I suppose, that we should drive up to my place of confinement\\ngrandly. Then a great idea seized me. My box was under the seat behind.\\nI had all my belongings with me. There were no walls to restrain us now.\\n\\n“Uncle,” I whispered, “I don’t want to go there. You once said you were\\ntired of houses. Why shouldn’t we run away?”\\n\\nHe heard the tremble in my voice. He lifted me in beside him and drove\\nalong the outside of the school-walls, not entering at the gate.\\n\\n“It’s beastly hard,” he said, “and the trouble is that I can’t explain\\nit. All through life you’ll be wanting to run away, and all through\\nlife, if you’re not a coward, you won’t be able. You see, people have to\\nearn a living in this world, and to earn a living they must be educated.\\nYour father’s trying to give you the best education he can, and he means\\nto be kind. But it’s a darned shame, this not being able to do what\\nyou like. I can’t run away with you, old chap. There’s nothing for it;\\nyou’ve just got to bear it.”\\n\\nHe stopped, searching for words. He wanted to tell me something really\\ncomforting and wasn’t content with what he had said. He found it.\\nTurning round in the dogcart, he threw his arm about my shoulder and\\npointed above my head, “Look up, there.” I raised my eyes and saw the\\nblue black sky like an inverted cup, with a red smudge round the western\\nrim where a mouth of blood had stained it. One by one the silver stars\\nwere coming out and disappearing, like tiny bubbles which break and form\\nagain. As I looked, night seemed to deepen; horizons dropped back; the\\nearth fell away. The sky was no longer a cup; it was nothing measurable.\\nIt was a drifting sea of freedom, and I was part of it.\\n\\n“They can rob you of a lot of things,” my uncle said, “but they can\\nnever take that from you. It’s like the world of your imagination,\\nsomething that can’t be stolen, and that you can’t sell, and that you\\ncan’t buy. It’s always yours.”\\n\\nWe drove through the gate to the main entrance. My box was deposited\\nin the hall. My uncle shook hands with me in formal manner when he said\\ngood-by, for the school-porter was present. He turned round sharply to\\ncut proceedings short, and disappeared into the night. I listened to his\\nwheels growing fainter. For the first time I was utterly alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II--CHILDISH SORROWS AND CHILDISH COMFORTERS\\n\\nIn delicate schoolboy slang, I was a new-bug--a thing to be poked and\\ndespised, and not to be spoken to for the first few days. There were\\nother new-bugs, which was some consolation; but we were too shy to get\\nacquainted. We moped about the playground sullen and solitary, like\\ncrows on a plowed field. Every now and then some privileged person, who\\nwas not a new-bug, would bang our shins with a hockey-stick; after which\\nwe would hop about on one leg for a time, looking more like crows than\\never.\\n\\nThe Snow Lady had packed fifty oranges in my box. I made holes in the\\ntops of them with my thumb and rammed in lumps of sugar, sucking out the\\njuice. Not because I was greedy, but because there seemed nothing else\\nto do, I ate every one of the fifty the first day. The following night I\\nwas ill, which did not help my popularity. One dark-haired person, about\\nmy own age, with a jolly freckled face, took particular offense at my\\nmisdemeanor. His real name was Buzzard, but he was nicknamed the Bantam\\nbecause of his size and his temper. He never said a word about the\\noranges, but he punished me for having been ill by stamping on my toes.\\nHe did this whenever he passed me, looking in the opposite direction in\\nan absent-minded fashion. My quietness in putting up with him seemed to\\nirritate him.\\n\\nThe afternoon was frosty; I was hobbling miserably about the playground\\nwith Ruthita’s muffler round my throat. It was a delicate baby-pink, and\\nthe Bantam easily caught sight of it. He came up and jerking it from me,\\ntrod on it. I had never fought in my life, but my wretchedness made me\\nreckless. I thought of little Ruthita and the long cold hours she\\nhad spent in making it. It seemed that he had insulted her. I hit him\\nsavagely on the nose.\\n\\nImmediately there were cries of, “A fight! A fight!” Games were stopped.\\nBoys came running from every direction. Even the new-bugs lifted up\\ntheir heads and began to take an interest in the landscape.\\n\\n“Now you’ve done it,” the Bantam shouted.\\n\\nHe started out, accompanied by the crowd to the bottom of the\\nplayground. I followed. The laboratory, a long black shed, stood there,\\nwith a roof of galvanized iron and rows of bottles arranged in the\\nwindows. Behind it we were out of sight of masters, unless they happened\\nto be carrying on experiments inside.\\n\\nA ring was formed. The Bantam commenced to take off his coat and collar.\\nI did likewise. A horrid sickening sense of defenselessness came over\\nme. I experienced what the early Christians must have felt when they\\ngazed round the eager amphitheatre, and heard the lions roaring.\\n\\nA big fellow stepped up. “Here, new-bug, d’you know how to fight?”\\n\\nWhen I shook my head, he grinned at me cheerfully. “Hold your arms well\\nup, double your fists, and go for him.”\\n\\nThe advice was more easy to give than to put into action. The Bantam was\\non top of me in a flash. He made for my face at first, but I lowered my\\nhead and kept my arms up, so he was content to pummel me about the body.\\nHe hurt, and hurt badly; I had never been treated so roughly.\\n\\nSomething happened. Perhaps it was a fierce realization of the injustice\\nof everything--the injustice of being sent there by people whom I loved,\\nthe injustice of not being spoken to, the injustice of the boys jeering\\nbecause I was getting thrashed. I felt that I did not care how much I\\ngot damaged if only I might kill the Bantam. He thumped me on the nose\\nas I looked up; my eyes filled with tears. I dashed in at him, banging\\nhim about the head. I heard his teeth rattle. I heard the shouting,\\n“Hurrah! Go it, new-bug. Well done, new-bug.” In front of me the wintry\\nsunset lay red. I remember wondering whether it was sunset or blood.\\nThen the Bantam tried to turn and run. I caught him behind the ear. He\\ntripped up and fell. I stood over him, doubtful whether he were dead.\\nJust then the door of the laboratory opened. The boys began to scatter,\\nshouting to one another, “The Creature! Here he comes. The Creature!”\\n The Bantam picked himself up and followed the crowd.\\n\\nA man came round the side of the shed. He looked something like\\nDot-and-Carry-One, only he was smaller. His hair was the color of a\\nbadger’s, shaggy and unbrushed. His face was stubbly and besmirched with\\ndifferent  chalks from his fingers. His clothes were stained and\\nbaggy. He approached sideways, crabwise, in a great hurry, with one hand\\nstretched out behind and one in front, like flappers. His gestures\\nwere those of a servant in a Chinese etching; they made him absurdly\\nconspicuous by their self-belittlement. Beyond everything, he was dirty.\\n\\n“What they been beating you for?” he inquired in his shorthand way of\\ntalking. “You hit him first! What for?” He pulled a stump of a pencil\\nout of his mouth as though he were drawing a tooth. After that I could\\nhear him more clearly. “A muffler? He trod on it? Well, that’s nothing\\nto fight about. Oh, your sister gave it you? That’s different.”\\n\\nThe last two sentences were spoken very gently--quite unlike the rest,\\nwhich had been angry. “Humph! His sister gave it him!”\\n\\nHe took me by the hand and led me into the shed, closing the door behind\\nhim. An iron stove was burning. The outside was red hot; it glowered\\nthrough the dusk. Running round the sides of the room were taps and\\nbasins, and above them bottles. Ranged on the table in the middle were\\nstands, bunsen-burners and retorts. He went silently about his work. He\\nwas melting sulphur in a crucible.\\n\\nEvery now and then the sulphur caught and burnt with a violet flame; and\\nall the while it made a suffocating smell.\\n\\nI felt scared. I didn’t know what he was going to do with me. The boys\\nhad called him The Creature, which sounded very dreadful. He had dragged\\nme into his den just like the ogres the Snow Lady read about.\\n\\nPresently his experiment ended. He gave me a seat by the stove, and came\\nand sat beside me. He didn’t look at all fierce now. He struck me as old\\nand discouraged.\\n\\n“Always fight for your sister,” he said. Then after a pause, “What’s she\\ncalled?”\\n\\nI found myself telling him that she wasn’t really my sister, that her\\nname was Ruthita, and that she had knitted me the muffler. He patted me\\non the knee as I talked. He might almost have been The Spuffler.\\n\\n“Boys are horrid beasts,” he said. “They don’t mean to be unkind. They\\ndon’t think--that’s all. Soon you’ll be one of them.”\\n\\nHe led the way out of the laboratory, turning the key behind him. The\\nbell in the tower was ringing for supper. The school was all lit up.\\nHe climbed the railing which divided the playground from the football\\nfield, telling me to follow. We passed across the meadows to the\\nvillage, which lay on the northward side of Eden Hill; it snuggled\\namong trees. The cottages were straw-thatched. Frost glistened on the\\nwindow-panes, behind which lamps were set. Unmelted snow glimmered here\\nand there in the gardens in patches among cabbage stumps. We turned in\\nat a gate. The Creature raised the latch of the door and we entered.\\n\\nHow cozy the little house was after the bare stone corridors and cold,\\nboarded dormitories. All the furnishings of the room into which he led\\nme were worn and out-of-date; but they had a homelike look about them\\nwhich atoned for their shabbiness. The walls bulged. Pictures hung awry\\nupon them. The springs of the sofa had burst; you sank to an unexpected\\ndepth when you sat upon it. The carpet was threadbare; patch-work rugs\\ncovered the worst places. Yet for all its poverty, you knew that it\\nwas a room in which people had loved and been kind to one another. An\\natmosphere of memory hung about it.\\n\\nThe Creature appeared to be his own house-keeper. He left me alone while\\nhe went somewhere into the back to get things ready. I could hear him\\nstriking matches and jingling cups against saucers.\\n\\nAs I sat looking curiously round at wax-fruit in glass-cases and a\\nstuffed owl on the mantel-shelf, the door was pushed open gently. An\\nold lady entered. She trod so lightly, gliding her feet along the floor,\\nthat I should not have heard her save for the turning of the handle.\\nShe was dressed from head to foot in clinging muslin. Her face and hands\\nwere so frail and white that you could almost see through them. Her\\nfaded hair fell disordered and scanty about her shoulders. Her eyes were\\nunnaturally large and luminous. She showed no surprise at seeing me.\\nShe looked at me so stealthily that she seemed to establish a secret.\\nCrossing her hands on her breast she courtesied, and then asked me as\\nodd a question as was ever addressed to a little boy. “Are you my Lord?”\\n\\n“If you please, mam,” I faltered, “I’m Dante Cardover.”\\n\\nHer look of intense eagerness faded, and one of almost childish\\ndisappointment took its place. She moved slowly about the room, from\\ncorner to corner, bowing to people whom I could not see and whispering\\nto herself.\\n\\nMy host came shuffling along the passage. He was carrying a tea-tray.\\nWhen he saw the woman, he set it hurriedly down on the table and went\\nquietly towards her. “Gipie,” he said, “Egypt, we’re not alone; we have\\na guest. Tell them to go away.”\\n\\nHe spoke to her soothingly, as though she were a child. Her eyes\\nnarrowed, the strained far-away expression left her face. She made a\\nmotion with her hand, dismissing the invisible persons. He led her to\\nme. It was strange to see a grown woman follow so obediently.\\n\\n“Gipie,” he said, “I want you to listen to me. This boy is my friend.\\nThey were fighting him up there,” jerking his head in the direction of\\nthe school. “He’s lonely; so I brought him to you. Tell him that you\\ncare.”\\n\\nThe old lady lifted her hands to my shoulders--such pale hands. “I’m\\nsorry,” she said. It was like a child repeating a lesson.\\n\\nHe introduced us. “This is my sister, Egypt; and this is Dante\\nCardover.”\\n\\nI don’t know what we talked about. I can only remember that the little\\nold man and woman were kind to me and gave me courage. There are\\ndesolate moments in life when one hour of sympathy calls out more\\ngratitude than years of easy friendship.\\n\\nThat night as the Creature walked back with me from his cottage, he told\\nme to come to him whenever I was lonely. At the Red House he explained\\nmy absence to the house-master. I went upstairs to the dormitory, with\\nits rows of twelve white beds down either side, feeling that I had\\nparted from a friend.\\n\\nAs I undressed in the darkness the Bantam spoke to me. “Didn’t mean to\\nfight you, Cardover. Make it up.”\\n\\nSo I made it up that night with the boy whose nose I had punched. He was\\na decent little chap when off his dignity. We began to make confidences\\nin whispers; I suppose the darkness helped us. He told me that his\\nfather was in India and that he hadn’t got a mother. I told him about\\nthe Snow Lady, and Hetty, and Uncle Obad; I didn’t tell him about\\nRuthita because of the muffler. Then I began to ask him about the\\nCreature. I wanted to know if that was his name. The Bantam laughed.\\n“Course not. He’s Murdoch the stinks’ master. We call him the Creature\\n’cause he looks like one. Weren’t you funky when he took you to his\\nrabbit-hutch? Was Lady Zion there?”\\n\\n“Lady Zion?”\\n\\n“Yes. Lady Zion Holy Ghost she calls herself. She’s his sister, and\\nshe’s balmy.”\\n\\nHe was going to enter into some interesting details about her, when the\\nmonitor and the elder boys came up. He hid his face in the pillow and\\npretended to be sleeping soundly.\\n\\n“The Bantam needs hair-brushing,” the monitor announced. “Here you, wake\\nup. You’re shamming.” He pulled the clothes off the Bantam’s bed with\\none jerk. The Bantam sat up, rubbing his eyes with a good imitation of\\nhaving just awakened.\\n\\n“Out you come.”\\n\\nOne boy held his hands and another his legs, bending his body into a\\npraying attitude. He fought like a demon, but to no purpose. They yanked\\nhis night-shirt up, while the monitor laid into him with the bristly\\nside of a hairbrush. He addressed him between each blow. “That’s one for\\nbullying a new-bug. And that’s another for fighting. And that’s another\\nfor being licked and getting in a funk, etc.” By the time they had done\\nhe was sobbing bitterly. Then the light went out.\\n\\nI suppose I ought to have been glad at being avenged; but I wasn’t.\\nSomehow I felt that the big boys had punished him not from a sense of\\njustice, but only because they were big and wanted to amuse themselves.\\nThen I got to thinking what a long way off India was, and how dreadful\\nit must make a boy feel never to see his father. It had been a long\\nwhile dark in the dormitory and almost everyone was breathing heavily.\\nI stretched out my hand across the narrow alley which separated me from\\nthe Bantam.\\n\\n“Bantam,” I whispered.\\n\\nHe snuffled.\\n\\n“Bantam.”\\n\\nI felt his fingers clutch my hand. I crept out and put my arms about\\nhim. Then I got into his bed and curled up beside him, and so we both\\nwere comforted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III--THE WORLD OF BOYS\\n\\nThe Bantam and I became great friends. He was a brave daredevil\\nlittle chap, prematurely hardened by the absence of home influences\\nto make the best of life’s vicissitudes. Within an hour of having been\\nbeaten, he would be gay again as ever. He was a soldier’s son, and never\\nwasted time in pitying himself. He was greedy for joy, as I am to this\\nday, and we contrived to find it together.\\n\\nYet, when I look back, the making of happiness at the Red House seems to\\nme to have been very much like manufacturing bricks without straw. I am\\namazed at our success. Very slight provision was made for our comfort.\\nOur daily routine was in no way superior to that of a barrack; the only\\ndifference was that they drilled our heads instead of our arms and\\nlegs. The feminine influence was entirely lacking, and a good deal of\\nbrutality resulted. If the parents could have guessed half the shocking\\nthings that their fresh-faced innocent looking darlings did and said in\\nthe three months of each term that they were away from home, they would\\nhave been broken-hearted. And yet they might have guessed. For here\\nwere we, young animals in every stage of adolescence, herded together in\\nclass-rooms and dormitories, uninformed about ourselves, with only paid\\npeople to care for us.\\n\\nApart from the masters we governed ourselves by a secret code of honor.\\nOne of the favorite diversions, when things were dull, was to find some\\nboy who was unpopular, in a breach of schoolboy etiquette. He would\\nthen be led into a class-room, held down over a desk, and thrashed with\\nhockey-sticks. I have seen a boy receive as many as ninety strokes, laid\\non by various young barbarians who took a pride in seeing who could hit\\nhardest. Usually at the end of it the victim was nearly fainting,\\nand would be lame for days after. The masters knew all about such\\nproceedings, but they were too indifferent to interfere. They boasted\\nthat they trusted to the school’s sense of justice.\\n\\nA boy, who was at all sensitive, went about in a state of terror. If\\nyou escaped hockey-sticks by day, there was always the dormitory and\\nhair-brush to be dreaded. The way to get beyond the dread of such\\npossibilities was to make yourself popular, and the easiest way to\\nbecome popular was to play ingenious pranks on the masters.\\n\\nThe glorious hours of liberty that broke up the monotonous round of\\ntasks stand out in vivid contrast to the discipline. We lived for them\\nand kept charts of the days, because this seemed to bring them nearer.\\nThere were two half-holidays a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, on\\nwhich, if sufficient excuse were given, we were allowed to go out of\\nthe school-grounds. If the permission were withheld, we broke bounds\\nand took the risk of discovery and consequent thrashings. These stolen\\nexpeditions had a zest about them that made them the more pleasurable.\\n\\nThe Bantam and I did most things together. We had a common fund of\\nmoney. His memories of India lent a touch of romance to our friendship.\\nHe would spin long yarns of man-eating tigers and terrible battles with\\nhill-tribes. He had a lurid imagination and added some fresh detail each\\ntime he told his tales. Not to be behindhand, I narrated my escape to\\nthe forest--leaving out the Ruthita part of it--and how Lilith had made\\nme a gipsy.\\n\\nThese stories became a secret between us which we shared with no one.\\nWe created for ourselves a mirage world which we called IT. In IT we had\\nonly to speak of things and they happened. In IT there were man-eating\\ntigers to whom we threw our masters when they had been unpleasant to us.\\nWe would drag them by their feet through the jungle, and then let out\\na low blood-thirsty wailing sound. Immediately we had done it, we would\\ndrop our victim and climb trees, for we could hear the tigers coming.\\nThe victim was bound so he couldn’t run away and while he lay there\\n“in the long rank grass with bulging eyes,” we would remind him of his\\ncrimes committed at the Red House. The account of his tortures and dying\\nwords would become a dialogue between the Bantam and myself.\\n\\n“Then the tiger seized him by the arm and chawed him,” the Bantam would\\nsay.\\n\\n“And the other tiger seized him by the leg, pulling in an opposite\\ndirection,” said I.\\n\\n“Then old Sneard looked up at me, with imploring eyes. ‘I’ve been a\\nbeast,’ he moaned, ‘and you were always a good boy. Call them off for\\nthe sake of my little girl.’ But I only laughed sepulchrally,” said the\\nBantam.\\n\\n“Your little girl will be jolly well glad when you’re dead,” said I.\\n\\n“Everybody will be glad,” said the Bantam. “And then a third tiger crept\\nout of the bushes and bit off his head, putting an end to his agony.”\\n\\n“You needn’t have killed him so soon,” I would expostulate\\ndiscontentedly. “I’d got something else I wanted to do to him.”\\n\\n“All right,” the Bantam would assent cheerfully; “let’s kill him again.”\\n\\nSo real was this land of IT to us, that we would shout with excitement\\nas we reached the climax of our narrations. The English fields through\\nwhich we wandered became swamps, deserts, and forests at will.\\n\\nIt became part of our game to pretend that we might meet Lilith any day.\\nOften we would break bounds, stealing down country lanes and peering\\nthrough hedges, hoping that at the next turn we should discover her\\nseated before her camp-fire. Hope deferred never curbed our eagerness;\\nwe always believed that we should meet her next time.\\n\\nIf we did not meet Lilith, we met someone equally strange--Lady Zion,\\nthe Creature’s sister. It was the Bantam who told me all about her.\\n“She’s wrong up there,” he said, tapping his forehead. “She thinks she’s\\nsomething out of the Bible; that’s why she calls herself Lady Zion Holy\\nGhost. She goes about the country dressed in white, riding on a donkey,\\nmuttering to herself, looking for someone she can never find. She thinks\\nthat she’s in love with old Sneard, and that he don’t care for her. They\\nsay that once he was going to marry her and then threw her over. That’s\\nwhat sent her balmy.”\\n\\nWhen I grew older I learnt the truth about the Creature and his sister.\\nHe became a firm friend of mine before schooldays were ended. He was a\\nman who possessed a faculty for not getting on in the world which, had\\nit been of value, would have amounted to genius. Anyone else with his\\nbrains and instinct for daring guess-work in scientific experiment,\\nwould have made a reputation. Instead of which he pottered his life\\nout at the Red House, defending his sister and allowing himself to be\\nimposed on both by boys and masters.\\n\\nPopularity was the armor which permitted you to do almost anything with\\nimpunity. A boy would take almost any chance to get it. Very early in my\\nschool experience the Bantam thought out a plan which he invited me to\\nshare--with the dire result that I was brought into intimate contact\\nwith Mr. Sneard.\\n\\nEvery night between seven and eight the lower forms assembled to prepare\\ntheir next day’s lessons. The Creature usually presided, chiefly because\\nhe was good-natured and the other masters were lazy. It was part of\\nhis penance. The room in which we assembled was illumined by oil-lamps,\\nwhich hung low on chains from the ceiling. If the chimney of one of\\nthese broke, the light became so bad in that quarter that work was\\nsuspended until it had been replaced. The Bantam conceived the happy\\nidea of persuading them to break in an almost undiscoverable manner. It\\nwas simplicity itself--to spit across the room so skilfully as to hit\\nthe chimney, whereupon the moisture on the hot glass would cause it to\\ncrack. We practised at sticks and gate-posts in the fields at first;\\nhaving become more or less proficient, we practised aiming at objects\\nabove our heads. This was more difficult. Our progress was slow; it was\\ndry work. Still, within a month we considered ourselves adepts.\\n\\nOne night in prep we put our plan to the test. The Creature was seated\\nat his raised desk, absorbed in some scientific work. The Bantam,\\njudging his distance carefully, took aim and the chimney cracked.\\nAs soon as the lamp-boy had been sent for and the chimney had been\\nreplaced, it was my turn. I was no less successful. For a week prep\\nwas disorganized; every night the same thing happened. I felt secretly\\nashamed of myself, for I knew that I was behaving meanly to a man who\\nhad always been kind in his dealings with me; but I was intoxicated with\\npopularity. The Bantam and I were the heroes of the hour. Boys who had\\nnever condescended to speak to us, now offered us their next week’s\\npocket-money to instruct them in an art in which we excelled. Games were\\nabandoned. All over the play-ground groups of young ruffians might be\\nseen industriously spitting at some object by the hour together.\\n\\nI suppose the Creature must have watched us from the laboratory and\\nput two and two together. One night, when three chimneys had broken in\\nsuccession, he caught me in mid-act. I say he caught me, but he did not\\nso much as look up from the book he was reading. He just said, without\\nraising his head, “Cardover, you must report yourself to Mr. Sneard\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\nTo have to report oneself to Mr. Sneard was the worst punishment that\\nan under-master could measure out. Somehow it had never entered my head\\nthat the Creature would be so severe as that. Why, I might get expelled\\nor publicly thrashed! My imagination conjured up all sorts of disgraces\\nand grisly penalties.\\n\\nThat night in the dormitory the Bantam told me of a way in which I might\\nsave myself; it was my first lesson in the value of diplomacy in helping\\none out of ticklish situations. It appeared that Mr. Sneard was always\\nlenient with a boy who professed conversion.\\n\\nNext day as I was hesitating outside his private room, screwing up my\\ncourage to tap, the Bantam sidled up behind me. “I’m going too,” he\\nsaid. Before I could dissuade him, he had turned the handle.\\n\\nSneard was a sallow cadaverous person; he affected side-whiskers and\\nhad red hair. He wore clerical attire, the vest of which was very\\nmuch spotted through his nearsightedness when he ate at table. He was\\nprobably the least scholarly master in the school, but he owed his\\nposition to his manners. They were unctuous, and had the reputation of\\ngoing down with the parents. I suppose that was how he caught my father.\\nHe composed hymns, which he set to music and compelled us to sing on\\nSundays. They were mostly of the self-abasement order, in which we spoke\\nof ourselves as worms and besought the Almighty not to tread on us. For\\nyears my mental picture of God was that of a gigantic school-master in\\nholy orders, very similar in appearance to Sneard himself.\\n\\nWhen we entered, he was seated behind his desk writing. He prolonged our\\nsuspense by pretending not to see us for a while. Suddenly he cast aside\\nhis pen and wheeled round in a storm of furious anger. When he spoke, it\\nsounded like a dog yapping.\\n\\n“You young blackguards, what’s this I hear about you?”\\n\\nHe forced us to tell him the stupid details of our offense. He could\\nhave had no sense of humor, for while we were speaking he covered his\\neyes with his hand as though staggered with horror at the enormity of\\nour depravity. Later experience has taught me that what he meant us to\\nbelieve was that he was engaged in prayer.\\n\\nWhen in small throaty whispers we had finished our confession, he looked\\nup at us. “Your poor, poor fathers,” he said, “one in India and one my\\nfriend! What shall I tell them? How shall I break this news to them?”\\n\\nThen he straightened himself in his chair. “There’s nothing else for it;\\nCardover, it’s over there. Will you please fetch it?”\\n\\nHe pointed to a cane in the corner, which leant against a book-shelf. It\\nwas at this crisis that the Bantam made use of his stratagem.\\n\\n“If you please, sir, I’ve been troubled about my soul again.” Then he\\nadded loyally, “And Cardover’s been lying awake of nights thinking about\\nhell.”\\n\\nIf the truth be told I had been lying awake imagining Sneard being bled\\nto death very slowly, and very torturingly, by a hill-tribe. But Sneard\\ncaught at the bait. “I am glad to hear it. Cardover, before I cane you,\\ncome here and tell me about your views on hell.”\\n\\nBefore we left him, great crocodile tears were streaming from our eyes\\nby reason of knuckles rubbed in vigorously. We were not punished.\\nThe last sight I had of Sneard he was gazing with holy joy at a great\\noil-painting of himself which hung above his desk.\\n\\nMost of the boys in the Red House were converted many times--as often\\nas they came within reach of the birch. Sneard made much coin out of\\nreferring to these touching spiritual experiences in public gatherings\\nof parents. I have never been able to decide whether we really did\\nfool him. I am inclined to believe that his eyes were wide open to our\\nhypocrisy, but that he found it paid to encourage it. Part of his salary\\nwas derived from percentages on the tuition fees of all boys over a\\ncertain number. He found that the best card to play with parents for the\\nattracting of new pupils, was a statement of the numerous conversions\\nwhich were brought about through his influence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV--NEW HORIZONS\\n\\n\\nThe Bantam and I won immunity from bullying in a quite unexpected\\nmanner.\\n\\nOur beds stood next together. Every night the younger boys were sent up\\nto the dormitory at nine; fifteen minutes later the lights were turned\\nout. The upper-classmen didn’t come up till ten. For three-quarters\\nof an hour each night we could whisper together in comparative\\nprivacy about IT, going on wildest excursions in our hidden land. Not\\nunnaturally the curiosity of the other small boys of our dormitory was\\naroused--they wanted to share our secret, and we wouldn’t let them. We\\nwere quite their match if it came to a fight, which was all the more\\nirritating. We steadily refused to fight with them, or play with them,\\nor to tell them anything. They became sulky and suspicious; in their\\nopinion our conversation was too low to bear repetition. I suppose one\\nof them must have sneaked to Cow--Cow was monitor of our dormitory.\\nOne night he came up early and on tiptoe. The first thing I knew he was\\nstanding in the darkness looking down on me, where I lay whispering on\\nthe Bantam’s bed. I was fairly caught.\\n\\n“Young’un, what’s that you’re saying?” he asked sternly.\\n\\nTo have told him would have spoilt everything. Only when my night-shirt\\nhad been stripped off and I saw that a grand gala-night of hair-brushing\\nwas being planned, did I venture an explanation.\\n\\n“I was only telling the Bantam a story.”\\n\\n“That’s a lie. Let’s hear it,” said the Cow.\\n\\n“I can’t begin when you’ve got my shirt,” I expostulated. “Let me get\\nback into bed; then I’ll tell you.”\\n\\nIt was arranged that I should be given a respite while the older boys\\nundressed. Once safe in bed, I set my imagination galloping.\\n\\n“Once upon a time,” I commenced, “there was a great pirate and he was\\nknown as the Pirate King. He had a wife called One-Eye, and she was the\\nonly person he was afraid of in all the world. He sailed the blood-red\\nseas with a crew of smugglers and highwaymen, most of whom he had\\nrescued at the last minute from the gallows. They were devoted to him,\\nand the vessel in which he sailed was called _The Damn_.”\\n\\nThe name of the vessel fetched them. There was no more talk of\\nhair-brushing. At half-past ten the light went out and we heard old\\nSneard shuffling down the passage, going his final round of inspection.\\nAt each door he halted, lifting his candle above his head and craning\\nout his long thin neck. Satisfied that all was in order, he shuffled on\\nto his own quarters and we heard his door slam. That night I must have\\nlain in the darkness recounting the adventures of the Pirate King till\\nlong past twelve. Every now and then a voice would interrupt me from one\\nof the narrow white beds, asking a question. I fell asleep in the midst\\nof my recounting.\\n\\nAfter that it became a practice that each night a fresh development in\\nthe life of this wonderful man should be unfolded. It was a good deal\\nof a tax on the imagination, but the Bantam came to my help, and we told\\nthe story turn and turn about. We told how _The Damn_ sailed into Peru\\nand came back blood-drenched and treasure-laden; how the Pirate King took\\nstrange maidens to his breast in coloring all the way from alabaster\\nto ebony, and what his wife One-Eye had to say about it; how the Pirate\\nKing could never be defeated and became so strong that he made himself\\nPope till he got tired of it. Discrepancies in chronology caused us no\\nmore inconvenience than they usually do historic novelists. In our world\\nJoan of Arc and Julius Cæsar were contemporaries. They met for the first\\ntime as prisoners, when they were introduced by the Pirate King on board\\n_The Damn_. It was owing to the Roman Emperor that the Maid escaped and\\nsurvived to be burnt.\\n\\nBut the part which found most favor was that which described the sack of\\nLondon, and how the boys of the Red House enlisted with the pirates and\\ntook all the masters, except the Creature, out to sea and made them walk\\nthe plank. I refused to allow the Creature to be murdered.\\n\\nWhen the story became personal, the Bantam and I discovered ourselves\\nthe possessors of unlimited power. We were lords of the other boys’\\ndestinies. We could make them heroes or cowards, give them fair maidens\\nor forget to say anything about them. Frequently we received bribes to\\nlet the giver down easily or to make him appear more valiant. I’m afraid\\nwe drifted into being tyrants, like Nero and all the other men\\nwhose wills have been absolute, and took our revenge with the rod of\\nimagination. In the middle of some thrilling escapade of the pirates,\\nwhen only courage could save them from calamity, we would tell how one\\nof the boys in a near-by bed turned traitor and went over to the enemy.\\n\\nOut of the darkness would come an angry voice, “I didn’t, you little\\nbeasts. You know quite well, I didn’t.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, you did,” we would say, and proceed to make him appear yet\\nmore infamous. If he expostulated too frequently, arms would be reached\\nout and a shower of boots would fly about his head.\\n\\nOur reputation spread beyond the dormitory; the history of the Pirate\\nKing, his wife One-Eye, and the good ship _Damn_, became a kind of\\nschool epic in which all the latest happenings at the Red House were\\nchronicled. No one dared to offend us, small as we were. Like Benvenuto\\nCellini, sniffing his way through Europe and petulantly turning his\\nback on kings and cardinals with impunity, we attained the successful\\ngenius’s privilege of being detested for our persons, but treasured for\\nour accomplishments. So at last we were popular in a fashion.\\n\\nWhat contrasts of experience we had in those days!\\n\\nThe crestfallen returns to the Red House, with play-boxes stuffed with\\nfeeble comfort in the shape of chocolates and cake; the long monotony\\nof term-time with the dull lessons, the birchings, the flashes of\\nexcitement on half-holidays and the counting of the weeks till vacations\\ncame round; then the wild burst of enthusiasm when trunks were packed\\nand Sneard had offered up his customary prayer in his accustomed\\nlanguage, and we set off shouting on the homeward journey.\\n\\nAll the discipline and captivity were a small price to pay for the\\ngladness of those home-comings. Ruthita would be at the end of the Lane\\nwaiting for me, a little shy at first but undeniably happy. The\\nSnow Lady would be on the door-step, her pretty face all aglow with\\nmerriment. My father would forsake his study for the night and sit down\\nto talk to me with all the leisure and courtesy that he usually reserved\\nfor grown men. Until they got used to me again I could upset my tea at\\ntable, slide down the banisters, and tramp through the house with muddy\\nboots--no one rebuked me for fear the welcome should be spoiled. The\\nSnow Lady called me The Fatted Calf, wilfully misinterpreting the Bible\\nparable. Little by little Ruthita would lose her shyness; then we would\\nbegin to plan all the things we would do in the seemingly inexhaustible\\nperiod of freedom that lay before us. In those days weeks were as long\\nas years are now.\\n\\nThere was once a time when I had no secrets from Ruthita. But a change\\nwas creeping over us almost imperceptibly, forming little rifts of\\nreserve which widened. Walls of a new and more subtle kind were growing\\nup about us, dividing us for a time from one another and from everybody\\nelse.\\n\\nThere was one holiday in which I became friendly with a butcher-boy. He\\nwas a guinea-pig fancier; I arranged to buy one from him for a shilling.\\nMy intention was to give it to Ruthita on her birthday. I told no one of\\nmy plan--it was to be a surprise. A little hutch was knocked up in the\\ntool-shed which the old white hen had tenanted.\\n\\nThe night before the birthday the butcher-boy came, and smuggled the\\nlittle creature in at the gate. Next morning I wakened early. Ruthita\\nwas standing beside my bed in her long white night-gown, beneath which\\nher rosy toes peeped out. When I had kissed her, she seemed surprised\\nthat I had no present for her. I became mysterious. “You wait until I’m\\ndressed,” I said.\\n\\nSlipping into my clothes I ran into the garden to get things ready. To\\nmy unspeakable astonishment when I looked into the hutch, I found three\\nguinea-pigs, two of them very tiny, where only one had been the night\\nbefore. I felt that something shameful and indelicate had happened.\\nExactly what I could not say, but something that I could not tell\\nRuthita. When she traced me down to the tool-shed, I drove her away\\nalmost angrily; I felt that I was secretly disgraced.\\n\\nThat morning when the butcher-boy called for orders, I took him aside. I\\nsold him back the three guinea-pigs for ninepence, and thought the loss\\nof threepence a cheap price to pay to rid myself of such embarrassment.\\nThe butcher-boy grinned broadly and winked in a knowing manner. To me\\nit was all very serious, and with a boy’s pride I did not invite\\nenlightenment. I took Ruthita out and let her choose her own present up\\nto the value of ninepence. I lied to her, saying that that was what I\\nhad intended.\\n\\nArguing by analogy from this experience, I gradually came to realize\\nthat all about me was a world of passion, the first boundaries of which\\nI was just beginning to traverse.\\n\\nThe Bantam, having no home to go to, would sometimes return with me to\\nPope Lane for the vacation; the Snow Lady was attracted by his freckled\\nface and impudently upturned nose. In the early years he, Ruthita, and\\nI would play together. Then, as we grew more boyish, we would play games\\nin which she could not share. But at last a time came when I found that\\nit was I who was excluded.\\n\\nI found that Ruthita and the Bantam had a way of going off and hiding\\nthemselves. It was quite evident that they had secrets which they kept\\nfrom me. An understanding lay between them in which I could not share. I\\nbecame irritable and began to watch.\\n\\nOne summer evening after tea I could not find them, The gate into the\\nLane was unlatched; I followed. There was a deserted house no great way\\ndistant, standing shuttered in the midst of overgrown grounds. We had\\nfound a bar broken in the railings, and there the Bantam and I played\\nhighwaymen. Naturally I thought of this haunt first.\\n\\nCreeping through the long grass I came upon them. The Bantam had his\\narm about Ruthita’s waist. She was tossing back her hair; her face was\\nradiant. I could only catch a glimpse of her sideways, but it came home\\nto me that the qualities in her which, in my blindness, I had taken for\\ngranted, were beautiful and rare. As I watched, the Bantam kissed\\nher. She drew back her head, glad and yet ashamed. I crept away with\\na strange sense of forlornness in my heart; they had stumbled across a\\npleasure of which I was ignorant.\\n\\nPoor little Ruthita!--it was short-lived. Hetty, having quarreled with\\nthe gardener, had not married. What I had seen, she also saw a few days\\nlater and told my father. He was very angry. I can see Ruthita now, with\\nher long spindly legs and short skirts, standing up demurely to take her\\nscolding. I listened to the scorching words my father spoke to her; the\\nburden of his talk was that her conduct was unladylike. I came to her\\ndefense with the remark, “But, father, she only did what I saw you and\\nthe Snow Lady doing.”\\n\\nThat night I went to bed supperless and I had no more pocket-money for\\na week. The Bantam’s visit was cut short; he was bundled back to the Red\\nHouse. I was sent down to Ransby to stay with my Grandmother Cardover. I\\nhave the fixed remembrance of Ruthita’s eyes very red with weeping.\\nThe utmost comfort I could give her was the promise that I would carry\\nmessages of her eternal faithfulness to her lover on my return to\\nschool.\\n\\nThe world had grown very complicated. Love was either wicked or stupid.\\nHetty had acted as though it was wicked when I caught her with John; my\\nfather, when I had caught him, as though it was stupid. Yet he was not\\nashamed of love now that he was married. I could not see why Ruthita\\nshould be so scolded for doing what her mother did every day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V--THE AWAKENING\\n\\n\\nAt a distance I had been sorry for the Bantam, but at close quarters\\nhis hopeless passion for Ruthita bored me. On my return to the Red House\\nhe overwhelmed me with a flood of maudlin confessions. There was nothing\\npleased him better than to get me alone, so that he could outline to me\\nhis impossible plans for an early marriage. He talked of running away to\\nsea and making his fortune in a distant land. It sounded all very easy.\\nHis only fear was that in his long absence Ruthita might be forced to\\nmarry some other fellow. “Dante,” he would say, “you’re a lucky chap to\\nhave been always near her.”\\n\\nThis kind of talk irritated me, partly because I was jealous of an\\necstasy which I could not understand, and partly because I had known\\nRuthita so many years that I thought I knew her exact value a good deal\\nbetter than the Bantam. There was something very absurd, too, in the\\ncontrast between this gawky boy, with his downy face and clumsy hands,\\nand these exaggerated expressions of sentiment. I began to avoid him; at\\nthat time I did not know why, but now I know it was because of the herd\\nspirit which shuns abnormality.\\n\\nNevertheless he had stirred something latent within me. My days became\\nhaunted with alluring conjectures; beneath the cold formality of human\\nfaces and manners I caught glimpses of a boisterous ruffianly passion.\\nSometimes it would repel me, making me unspeakably sad; but more often\\nit swept me away in a torrent of inexplicable riotous happiness. I\\nhad come to an age when, shut him up as you may in the garden of\\nunenlightenment, a boy must hear from beyond the walls the pagan pipes\\nand the dancing feet of Pan.\\n\\nOf nights I would lie awake, still and tense, reasoning my way forward\\nand forward, out of the fairy tales of childhood into reality. Sometimes\\nI would bury my face in my pillow, half glad and half ashamed of my\\nstrange, new knowledge. Now all the glory of the flesh in the Classics,\\nwhich before had slipped by me when encountered as a schoolboy’s task,\\nburned in my brain with the vehement fire of immemorial romance.\\n\\nOld Sneard had a terrifying sermon, which he was fond of preaching on\\nSunday evenings when the chapel was full of shadows. His heated face,\\nstartlingly illumined by the pulpit-lamps, would take on the furious\\nearnestness of an accusing angel as he leant out towards us describing\\nthe spiritual tortures of the damned. He spoke in symbolic language of\\nthe causes which led up to damnation. Until quite lately I had wondered\\nwhat in the world he could be driving at. His text was, “Son of man,\\nhast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark,\\nevery man in his chambers of imagery?” The grotesque unreality of\\nlikening a group of school-boys to the elders of Israel never occurred\\nto me; I was too carried away by the reality of sin itself and the\\nterror of what was said. When service was ended I would steal up the\\nstone stairway to the dormitory in silence, almost fearful that my\\nguilt might be betrayed by my shadow....\\n\\nIt was summer-time. Those of us who professed an interest in entomology\\nwere permitted during the hour between prep and supper to rove the\\ncountry with butterfly-nets. The results of these expeditions were given\\nto the school natural history museum; most of the boys hunted in pairs.\\nThings being as they were between myself and the Bantam, I preferred to\\ngo by myself.\\n\\nAll day it had been raining. The sky was still damp with heavy clouds\\nand the evening fell early. I slipped out into the cool wet dusk, eager\\nto be solitary. Some boys were kicking a ball and called to me to come\\nand play with them. In my anxiety not to be delayed, I doubled up my\\nfists and ran. They followed in pursuit, but soon their shouts and\\nlaughter grew fainter, till presently I was alone in a dim, green world.\\nThe air was exquisitely fragrant with earth and flower smells. Far away\\nbetween the trees of Eden Hill a watery sunset faded palely. Nearer at\\nhand dog-roses and convolvuli glimmered in the hedges.\\n\\nI threw myself down in the dripping grass, lying full-length on my\\nback, so that I could watch the stars struggle out between the edges\\nof clouds. Oh, the sense of freedom and wideness, and the sheer joy\\nof being at large in the world! I listened to the stillness of\\nthe twilight, which is a stillness made up of an infinity of tiny\\nsounds--birds settling into their nests, trees whispering together, and\\nflowers drawing closer their fragile petals to shut out the cold night\\nair. I told myself that all the little creatures of the fields\\nand hedgerows were tucking one another safe in bed. Then, as if to\\ncontradict me, the sudden passion of the nightingale wandered down the\\nstairway of the silence, each note separately poignant, like glances of\\na lover who halts and looks back from every step as he descends. From\\nfar away the passion was answered, and again it was returned.\\n\\nA great White Admiral fluttered over my head. I picked up my net and\\nwas after it. So, in a second, the boy within me proved himself stronger\\nthan the man. But the butterfly refused to let me get near it and would\\nnever settle long enough for me to catch it.\\n\\nI followed from field to field, till at last it came to the\\ncricket-ground and made a final desperate effort to escape me by flying\\nover the hedge into the private garden of Sneard’s house. His garden\\nwas forbidden territory, but the twilight made me bold to forget that.\\nBreaking through the hedge I followed, running tiptoe down a path which\\nended in a summer-house. The White Admiral settled on a rosebush; I was\\nin the act of netting it when I heard someone stirring. Standing in the\\ndoorway of the summerhouse was a girl about as tall as myself. We eyed\\none another through the dusk in silence. Her face was indistinct and in\\nshadow.\\n\\n“You don’t know how you frightened me.”\\n\\nDirectly she spoke I knew that she was not Beatrice Sneard, as I had\\ndreaded. Her voice was too friendly; it had in it the lazy caressing\\nquality of a summer’s afternoon when bees are humming in and out of\\nflowers. Her way of pronouncing words was halting and slightly foreign.\\nIn after years I came to know just how much power of temptation her\\nvoice possessed.\\n\\n“I suppose you’re not allowed in here,” she said; “but you needn’t\\nworry--I shan’t tell.”\\n\\nThe boy in me prompted me to answer, “You can tell if you care to.”\\n\\nShe gave a secret little laugh. “But I shan’t.”\\n\\nAfter all my gallant imaginings of what I would do on a like occasion,\\nI stood before her awkwardly, tongue-tied and ungracious--so far removed\\nare dreams from reality. The White Admiral, tired with the long pursuit,\\nstill clung to the rose’s petals. Across misty fields nightingales\\ncalled, casting the love-spell, and the moon, in intermittent flashes,\\ncaused the dripping foliage to glisten.\\n\\nShe rested her hand on my arm--such a small white hand--and drew me into\\nthe seclusion of the summerhouse.\\n\\n“You’re not afraid of girls, are you?” she questioned, and then\\ninconsequently, “I’m awfully lonely.”\\n\\nThere was a note of appeal in her tones, so I found my tongue and asked\\nwhy she was lonely.\\n\\n“Because I quarrel with Beatrice--we don’t get on together. Do you know,\\nshe thinks all you boys are simply horrid persons?”\\n\\n“Perhaps we are,” I said. “Most people think that.”\\n\\n“But I don’t,” she answered promptly.\\n\\nGradually my constraint left me. She had an easy kindness and assurance\\nin her manner that I had never found in any other girl. She slipped her\\nhand into mine; made bold by the darkness of the summer-house, I held it\\ntightly.\\n\\n“I like you. I like you very much,” she whispered.\\n\\n“But you’ve never spoken to me before. Why should you like the?”\\n\\nShe turned her face to mine, so that our lips were quite near together.\\n“I suppose because I’m a girl.”\\n\\nThe bell for supper began to ring. I pretended not to hear it. Through\\nthe roses across the lawn I saw Sneard stand in his study-window,\\nstruggling into his gown. Then the window became dark and I knew that he\\nhad gone to read evening prayers.\\n\\n“The bell is ringing,” she said at last. “If you don’t go, you’ll get\\npunished.”\\n\\n“If it’s for your sake, I don’t care.”\\n\\nShe pushed me gently from her. “Go away now. If you get into trouble,\\nyou’ll not be able to come back tomorrow.”\\n\\nShe ran down the path with me as far as the hedge. The bell was at its\\nlast strokes, swinging slower and slower. At the hedge we halted. I knew\\nwhat I wanted to do; my whole body ached to take her in my arms\\nand kiss her. But something stronger than will--the habit of\\nrestraint--prevented. Some paces away on the other side of the hedge I\\nremembered that I did not even know her name. Without halting I called\\nback to her questioning, and as I ran the answer followed me through the\\nshadows, “Fiesole.”\\n\\nAfter the monitors had come up and the lights had been put out, I waited\\nfor an hour till all the dormitory was sleeping; then, very stealthily,\\nI edged myself out of bed. Standing upright, I listened to make sure\\nthat I was undetected. I stole out into the corridor bare-foot. I feared\\nto dress lest anyone should be aroused. In my long linen night-gown I\\ntiptoed down the corridor, down the stairs, and entered the fifth-form\\nclass-room. Throwing up the window I climbed out.\\n\\nAn English summer’s night lay before me in all its silver splendor--huge\\nshadows of trees, scented coolness of the air, and damp smoothness of\\nturf beneath my tread. The exultation of life’s bigness and cleanness\\ncame upon me. I knew now that it was right to be proud of the body and\\nto love the body. Oh, why had it been left to a glimpse in the dusk of a\\nyoung girl’s face to teach me that? At a rush I had become possessed\\nof all the codes of mediaeval chivalry. Every woman, however old\\nor unpleasing, was for Fiesole’s sake most perfect--a person to be\\nworshiped; for in serving her I should be serving Fiesole. What a name\\nto have! How all her perfectness was summed up in the beauty of those\\nfull vowel sounds, _Fi-es-sol-le_.\\n\\nI trespassed again in the garden. In the quiet of the rose-scented night\\nI entered the summer-house.\\n\\nFar away the nightingales sang on. There were words to their chanting\\nnow and their song was no, longer melancholy. And these were the words\\nas I heard them: “_Fiesole--Fiesole--Fiesole. Love in the world. Love in\\nthe world. Glad--glad--glad._”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI--WHAT IS LOVE?\\n\\nMy secret was too big and beautiful to keep to myself. There was no one\\nI could tell it to save the Bantam. But the Bantam had grown shy of me;\\nhe knew that within myself I had been laughing at him. He turned away\\nwhen I tried to catch his eye, and bent with unaccustomed diligence\\nabove his lessons.\\n\\nNot till after lunch did I get a chance to approach him. All the other\\nboys had changed into flannels and had hurried off to the cricket-nets.\\nI wandered into the empty playground and there found him seated alone\\nin a corner. His knees were drawn up so that his chin rested on them; in\\nhis eyes was a far-away sorrowful expression. I halted before him.\\n\\n“Bantam.”\\n\\nHe did not look up, but I knew by the twitching of his hands that he had\\nheard.\\n\\n“Bantam, I’ve got something to tell you.”\\n\\nSlowly he turned his head. He was acting the part of Hamlet and I was\\nvastly impressed. “Is it about Ruthita?”\\n\\n“Partly. But it’s happened to me too, Bantam.”\\n\\n“Wot?”\\n\\n“A girl.”\\n\\nA genuine look of live-boy astonishment overspread his countenance.\\n“A girl!” he ejaculated. “But there ar’n’t any about--unless you mean\\nPigtails.”\\n\\nPigtails was Beatrice Sneard, and I felt that an insult was being\\nleveled at me.\\n\\n“If you say that again, I’ll punch your head.”\\n\\n“Oh, so it is Pigtails.” He rose to his feet lazily and began to take\\noff his jacket. “Come on and punch it.”\\n\\nBut a fight wasn’t at all what I wanted. So I walked straight up to him\\nwith my hands held down.\\n\\n“Silly ass, how could it be Pigtails? Do I look that sort? It’s another\\ngirl. I came to you ’cause you’re in love, and you’ll understand. I’ve\\nbeen a beast to you--won’t you be friends?”\\n\\nI held out my hand and he took it with surly defiance. I was too eager\\nfor sympathy, however, to be discouraged.\\n\\n“She’s called Fiesole,” I said. “Isn’t that beautiful?”\\n\\n“Ruthita’s better.”\\n\\n“She’s got gold hair with just a little--a little red in it.”\\n\\n“I prefer black.”\\n\\n“I’m not talking about Ruthita; I’m telling you about Fiesole.”\\n\\n“I know that,” said the Bantam; “you never do talk about Ruthita now.”\\n\\nI walked away from him angrily in the direction I had taken on the\\nprevious evening. As I approached the nets I saw a little group of\\nspectators. Then I made out the clerical figure of Sneard and the figure\\nof Pigtails dressed in gray, and between them a slim white girl. Behind\\nme I heard the pit-a-pat of running feet on the turf. The Bantam flung\\nhis arm about my shoulders, saying, “I’ve been a beast and you’ve been a\\nbeast; but we won’t be beasts any longer.” Then, following the direction\\nof my eyes, “What are you staring at? Is that her? My eye, she’s a\\ntopper!”\\n\\nHe prodded me to go forward. When I showed reluctance, he used almost\\nFiesole’s words, “Why, surely, Dante, you ar’n’t afraid of a girl!”\\n\\nI was afraid, and always have been wherever my affections are concerned.\\nBut I wasn’t going to own it just then. I let him slip his arm through\\nmine, and we sauntered forward together. Through the soft summer air\\ncame the sharp _click_ of the ball as it glanced off the bat, and the\\nlong cheer which followed as the wicket went down. Fiesole turned,\\nclapping her hands, and our eyes met. Then she ceased to look at me; her\\ngaze rested on the Bantam, while a half-smile played about her mouth.\\nA pang of jealousy shot through me. With the instinctive egotism of\\nthe male, I felt that by the mere fact of loving her I had made her\\nmy property. However, Pigtails came to my rescue, for I saw her jolt\\nFiesole with her elbow; her shocked voice reached me, saying, “Cousin\\nFiesole, whatever are you staring at?”\\n\\nI tugged at the Bantam’s sleeve and we turned away.\\n\\n“My golly, but she is a ripper,” he whispered....\\n\\nAs the distance grew between us and her, he kept glancing across his\\nshoulder and once halted completely to gaze back. I envied him his\\neffrontery. My fate from the beginning has been to run away from the\\nwomen I love--and then to regret it.\\n\\nWe had entered into another field and were passing a laburnum tree,\\nwhen the Bantam drew up sharply. He pointed to its blossom all gold and\\nyellow. “The color of her hair,” he said, and promptly threw himself\\nunder it, lying on his back, gazing up at its burning foliage. The sun\\nfiltered down through its leaves upon us, making fantastic patterns on\\nour hands and faces. The field was tall in hay, ready for the cutting,\\nso we had the boy’s delight of being completely hidden from the world.\\n\\n“What’s the color of her eyes?” he asked presently.\\n\\n“Don’t know; it was dusk when I saw her. I expect it’s the same as\\nRuthita’s.”\\n\\n“Who is she?”\\n\\n“Met her in Sneard’s garden--Pigtails called her ‘cousin’ just now.”\\n\\n“She’s called Fiesole! Pretty name. How it suits her.”\\n\\n“Not prettier than Ruthita,” I said.\\n\\nHe sat up and grinned at me. “Who’re you getting at? You wanted me to\\nsay all that half-an-hour ago in the playground; now I’ve said it. I can\\nthink she’s pretty, can’t I, and still love Ruthita best?”\\n\\n“But you oughtn’t to love her at all,” I expostulated with a growing\\nsense of indignant proprietorship.\\n\\n“Look here,” explained the Bantam seriously, “you’re jealous. That’s\\nthe way I felt about you when you told me that you weren’t Ruthita’s\\nbrother; I quite understand. But if I’m to marry Ruthita, I shall be\\nyour brother-in-law. Sha’n’t I? And if you marry Fiesole, she’ll be my\\nsister-inlaw. Won’t she? Well then, I’ve got a right to be pleased about\\nher.”\\n\\nI took him at his word and told him everything that had happened and all\\nthat I knew about her. Continually he would break in with feverish words\\nof surprise and flattery, leading me on still further to confess myself.\\nIn the magic world of that summer’s afternoon no difficulties seemed\\ninsuperable. Married we could and would be. Parents and schoolmasters\\nonly existed for one purpose--to prevent boys and girls who fell in love\\nfrom marrying: that was why grown-ups had all the money. In a natural\\nstate of society, where men lived in the woods, and wore skins, and\\ncarried clubs, these injustices would not happen.\\n\\nSo we unbosomed ourselves, only understanding vaguely the immensities\\nthat love and marriage meant. Then the bell for four o’clock school\\nbegan calling and, like the slaves we were, we returned, on the run, to\\nthe Red House.\\n\\nWe found that we were not the only persons to be inflamed by the beauty\\nof Fiesole. All the boys were talking about her. One of our chief fears\\nwas set at rest--her surname was not Sneard, but Cortona. Her father\\nhad been a famous Italian actor married to Sneard’s sister, and both her\\nparents fortunately were dead. She had quite a lot of money and had come\\nfrom a convent at Tours, where she was being educated, to stay with\\nher uncle on a visit of undetermined length or brevity. This news had\\nall been gathered by the Cow, who had that curious faculty for worming\\nout information which some boys possess. He had extracted it from\\nthe groundman, who had extracted it from Sneard’s gardener, who had\\nextracted it from Sneard’s housemaid, with whom he was on more than\\nfriendly terms--so of course it was authentic.\\n\\nThat evening after prep I again stole out. The Bantam showed himself\\nvery impertinent--he wanted to come with me. I had great difficulty\\nin persuading him that it wasn’t necessary. I found Fiesole in the\\nsummer-house. She was subdued and wistful, and insisted on asking\\nquestions about that nice boy she had seen with me. I told her frankly\\nthat he was engaged to my sister, and gave her a graphic account of\\nhow my father had turned him out of Pope Lane. I fear I made him seem\\naltogether too romantic. She made careful inquiries about the appearance\\nof Ruthita, which I took as a sign of encouragement--a foreknowledge\\nthat sooner or later I intended to ask her to become one of my family.\\nWhen the bell rang for prayers and we parted, I held her hand a little\\nlonger, but experienced my old reluctance in the matter of kissing.\\n\\nNext morning fate played me a scurvy trick; I woke with a bad sore\\nthroat, due I suppose to my escapade of the night earlier, and was sent\\nto the infirmary. On the evening of the day I came out, which was four\\ndays later, I was summoned after prep to report myself to the doctor.\\nThis made me late in getting to the summer-house.\\n\\nThe bell for prayers had commenced to ring as I got there. I was\\nclimbing through the hedge when I heard footsteps on the garden path.\\nThere were two children standing hushed amid the roses, the one with\\nface tremulously uplifted, the other looking down with eager eyes. As I\\nwatched their lips met. It was impossible for me to stir without making\\nmy presence known. One of them came bolting into me, going out by the\\nway I was entering. We rolled over and I recognized the Bantam. Fiesole,\\nhearing the angry voices of two boys quarreling, ran. And so I got my\\nfirst experience of the lightness of woman’s affection.\\n\\nHowever, if I was seeking a revenge, I got it. Before the end of the\\nsummer term Pigtails became suspicious, and discovered the Cow in the\\nsummer-house with the fickle Fiesole. The Cow, because he was a monitor,\\nwas expelled and I was appointed in his place--Mordecai and Haman after\\na fashion. Fiesole, on account of her kissing propensities, was regarded\\nas a dangerous person and sent away. I was a grown man when next I met\\nher.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII--THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SPUFFLER\\n\\nIt was during the last week of the summer term, while I was\\nconvalescing from Fiesole’s sudden exit and was beginning to forgive the\\nBantam his treachery, that the magic personality of George Rapson first\\nflashed into my little world.\\n\\nI was sitting listlessly at my desk one sunshiny morning. The window at\\nmy side was open, commanding a view of the school garden, the driveway\\nleading through it, and beyond that of the sleepy village street. Below\\nthe window grew a bed of lavender whose fragrance, drifting in, made\\nme forgetful of the book which lay before me and of the master at the\\nblack-board chalking up dull problems in algebra. I was dreaming as\\nusual, telling myself a story of what I would do if old Sneard should\\npop his head inside the door and say, “My dear Cardover, you have worked\\nso well that I intend to make an example of you by giving you this day\\nas a holiday.”\\n\\nJust then the master at the board turned round and jumped me into a\\nrealization of the present. “Cardover, you will please stand up and\\nrepeat my explanation of this problem.”\\n\\nI stood up and gazed stupidly at the medley of signs and abbreviated\\nformulae, hoping to discover some clue of reasoning in their apparent\\nmeaninglessness. “Well?”\\n\\n“If you please, sir, I wasn’t attending.”\\n\\n“I thought not. If you had been, you would have known that I have not\\nexplained it yet. You will come to me after class and--”\\n\\nBut his sentence was never ended. At that moment the head of every boy\\nturned as one head; yes, and even the head of the master turned. Up the\\ndriveway came the sound of prancing hoofs, the soft crunch of wheels in\\nthe gravel, and cries of, “Whoa, girl! Steady there, steady.”\\n\\nPast the window flashed a high yellow dog-cart, drawn by a tandem of\\nspirited chestnuts. A tiger in livery and top-hat sat behind with arms\\nfolded, superbly aware of his own magnificence. Between the wheels ran\\na Dalmatian, a plum-pudding dog as we used to call them. On the high\\nfront-seat were two men, equally gorgeous. The one who drove wore a\\nlarge fawn coat with enormous pearl buttons, distinctly horsey in cut\\nand fashion. On his head was a tall beaver hat. He was a massively built\\nman and had the appearance of a sporting aristocrat. To make him more\\nsplendid, he was young, with a bronzed complexion, full red lips, and\\nfinely chiseled features. His companion looked like a Methodist parson,\\ntrying to pass as a racing gent. He was attired in a light tweed suit of\\na rather pronounced black and white check. On his head was a gray\\nfelt hat, and in his button-hole blazed a scarlet geranium. They were\\nlaughing in deep full-throated guffaws as they whizzed past, with the\\nsun flashing on their wheels and harness. The tiger and the Dalmatian\\nwere the only solemn things about them. What was my surprise to have\\nrecognized in the second man a relative?\\n\\n“It’s my uncle!”\\n\\nEven the master, so recently bent on my humiliation, seemed to hold\\nhis breath in regarding the nephew of so resplendent a person. Here was\\npoetic justice with a vengeance. Most of the boys’ friends, if they were\\ntoo rich to walk from the station when they came to visit them, crawled\\nup the hill in a musty creaking cab, with hard wooden seats, and two or\\nthree handfuls of straw on the floor, more or less dirty. In the history\\nof the Red House no boy’s relative had dashed up to visit him with such\\na barbaric clatter and display of wealth. Ah, if Fiesole had been there\\nto envy me, how she would have blamed herself for her falseness!\\n\\n“Cardover, you may sit down.”\\n\\nThe master turned again to the black-board, forgetting the threatened\\npenalty. The boys eyed me above the covers of their books, and awaited\\nfurther developments.\\n\\nThe door opened and Sneard peered round on us shortsightedly. A pleased\\nsmile played about the corners of his diplomatic mouth. His happiness at\\nreceiving such distinguished callers seemed to have had an effect upon\\nhis hair, turning it to a yet more fiery red. Usually when he spoke he\\nsnapped, but now his tones were as fluty as he could make them with so\\nlittle practice.\\n\\nTurning to the master, “Is Dante Cardover here?” he inquired. When I was\\npointed out to him he said, “Mr. George Rapson is here and with him your\\nuncle, Mr. Spreckles. You may take a holiday, Dante, and go out with\\nthem.”\\n\\nI rose from my seat in an ecstasy of bewilderment. What under the sun\\nhad happened that old Sneard should call me Dante, and who was Mr.\\nGeorge Rapson? As I picked my way through the labyrinth of forms and\\ndesks; getting glimpses of my school-mates’ lengthened faces, I felt\\nthat I was taking the sunlight from the room by my good fortune as I\\nleft.\\n\\nI followed Sneard to his study, which I had so often visited on such\\ndifferent errands. Even now as I crossed its threshold, I could not\\nquite shake off my accustomed clammy dread. The Spuffler, catching sight\\nof me, ran forward in his gayest manner. “Ah, Dante, old chap, it’s good\\nto see you. Rapson’s heard so much about you that he couldn’t keep away\\nany longer. ‘Spreckles,’ he said, ‘you’ve got to introduce me. It’s\\nDante, Dante, all day long. You can’t talk of anyone else.’ So here we\\nare. Rapson, this is my nephew.”\\n\\nMr. Rapson grabbed me by the shoulder with a large white hand and gazed\\ndown on me. There was a jolly-dog air about him combined with a big\\nhealthy strength, which made one both like and fear him from the first.\\nAnd there was so much of him to like; he was over six foot in height and\\nproportionately built in breadth. “Hm! Dante. Glad to meet you. Let’s\\nget out.”\\n\\nSneard wanted me to put on my Sunday suit, but Mr. Rapson wouldn’t\\nhear of it. “Hated clothes when I was a kid. Still think we ought to go\\nnaked. Let him be as he is. He’s got nothing to spoil and therefore’ll\\nenjoy himself.”\\n\\nWithout waiting for a reply, he nodded to Sneard, heaved his great\\nshoulders through the doorway, so down the hall and out on to the steps\\nwhere the tiger was holding the horses’ heads.\\n\\n“Just like Rapson,” my uncle said. “Masterful fellow. Makes up his mind\\nand then goes ahead. Good-day, Mr. Sneard. Oh, yes, we’ll take care of\\nhim and bring him back.”\\n\\nThey took me up in front beside them; the whip cracked and the tiger\\nsprang away from the leader. Off we sped, down the hill and into the\\nvalley, winding in and out of overgrown lanes where we had to duck our\\nheads to avoid the boughs; then out again with fields on either side of\\nus, up hill and down dale never slackening, with the wind on our cheeks\\nand the sun in our faces. Mr. Rapson’s attention was completely taken\\nup with his driving; it needed to be, for he swung round corners and\\nsqueezed between farm-wagons in outrageously reckless fashion. I watched\\nhis strong masterful hands, how they gathered in the reins and forced\\nthe horses to obedience. My eyes wandered up him and rested on his face:\\nthe face of a man a little over thirty, calm and yet when stern almost\\ncruelly determined, with a shapely beak of a Roman nose planted squarely\\nin the middle of it--a sign-post to his purpose.\\n\\nThen I glanced at my uncle with his fashionable checks and scarlet\\ngeranium. I remembered that my grandmother called him the Spuffler, and\\nwondered what she would call him now, could she see him. That nervous\\nair he had had, of at once asserting and apologizing for himself with\\na pitiful display of bluster, had vanished. He carried himself with the\\njaunty confidence of a middle-aged gentleman unsubdued by the world--one\\nwho knew how to be dignified when necessary, but who preferred\\nat present to relax. Above all he conveyed the impression of one\\nbeautifully fond of life’s simple pleasures and quietly composed in a\\nhappy self-respect. What had done it? Was it George Rapson, or had he at\\nlast had success with one of his poultry experiments?\\n\\nPerhaps he guessed some of the inquiries that were running through my\\nhead, for, as I crouched near him in the little space allotted me on our\\nhigh up perch, he squeezed my hand, hinting at some great secret, for\\nthe telling of which we must be alone by our two selves.\\n\\nWith foam flying from the horses’ mouths we entered Richmond and\\nglittered down those quaint and narrow streets, which have always seemed\\nto me more like streets of a seaport than of an inland town. We turned\\na corner; full before us drifted up the long and shadowy quiet of the\\nThames.\\n\\nMr. Rapson refused to be sociable until he had seen to the rubbing down\\nand stabling of his horses; so we two wandered off together along the\\nminiature quays, where boatmen with a deep-sea sailor’s swagger pulled\\nclay pipes from their mouths and wished us a cheerfully mercenary\\n“Good-mornin’.”\\n\\nMy curiosity was inarticulate with a multitude of crowding questions. I\\ncouldn’t make my choice which to ask first. I watched the swans sail\\nin and out the tethered boats, and racked my brain for words. Then I\\nblurted out, “What does it all mean, Uncle Obad?”\\n\\nHis eyes filled with tears. “My boy, it means success.”\\n\\nI mumbled something typically boylike and inadequate about being “jolly\\nglad.” He slipped his arm through mine with that endearing familiarity\\nhe had, as though I were a man. He was too excited to sit down, so we\\nstrolled along the quays, under the creeper-covered redbrick walls of\\nthe houses, and out of Richmond along the open river-bank.\\n\\n“No one ever believed that I’d do it, Dante. I don’t think you did\\nyourself. They all said, ‘Oh, Spreckles! Ha, the fellow who twiddles his\\nthumbs while his wife works!’ They didn’t say it to my face--they didn’t\\ndare. But that was what they thought about me. I seemed a failure--a\\ngood-natured incompetent. Even people who liked me felt ashamed of\\nme--I mean people who were dear to me, living in the same house. Women\\nwant their husbands to measure up to the standards of other men. It’s\\nnatural--I don’t blame ’em. But, you know, I never had a chance, old\\nchap--never seemed to find my right kind of work. I couldn’t do little\\nthings well. I’m one of those imperial men who need something big to\\nbring the best out of’ ’em. And now I’ve got it--I’ve got it, Dante.”\\n\\nI caught his excitement, and begged him to tell me what this wonderful\\nsomething was that had so suddenly transformed him from a nobody into\\na powerful person. I felt sure he was powerful, apart from anything he\\nsaid, for he radiated opulence. He halted in the middle of the tow-path,\\ngripping me by the shoulders, laughing into my face and bidding me\\nguess. I guessed everything possible and impossible. Losing patience,\\n“It’s diamond mines,” he burst out.\\n\\n“But how did you get ’em, Uncle Obad, and where?”\\n\\nFor an instant I had a wild vision of men with pickaxes, shovels, and\\nminers’ lamps, digging down into the bowels of the Christian Boarding\\nHouse.\\n\\nWe seated ourselves on the bank with legs dangling above the water,\\nand he told me. It seemed that Mr. George Rapson was the cause of this\\nmeteoric rise to prosperity. In April he had come to stay at Charity\\nGrove as an ordinary paying-guest. From the first he was extraordinary\\nand had amazed them with his wealth--his horses, his clothes, his\\nfriends, and his lavish manners. Most of his fellow boarders were\\nstruggling young men, who earned two pounds a week in the City and paid\\ntwenty-five shillings for their keep and lodging. On the start they only\\nknew that he was a South African, holiday-making in England. Little by\\nlittle he let out that he was interested in diamond mines, and later\\nthat he owned _The Ethiopian_, one of the most promising properties\\nof its kind in the world. The more communicative he became, the more\\nsurprised they were that he should make his head-quarters at a Christian\\nBoarding House. There seemed no reason why he should not pay a higher\\nprice and enjoy the advantages of a secular environment.\\n\\nOne night he took my uncle into his room, locked the door, and let\\nthe cat out of the bag. It was my uncle and his personality that had\\nattracted him. He had seen his name as secretary to so many thriving\\nphilanthropic societies that he had been led to appreciate his worth\\nas an organizer. He wanted his help. He had come to England to unload a\\nnumber of shares in _The Ethiopian_ diamond mines, but it had to be\\ndone quietly and without advertisement. He had a number of unscrupulous\\nenemies in the mining world who wanted to merge his property with\\ntheirs. They had tried to crowd him out in various ways--once by\\nbringing about a law-suit to dispute his title to his holdings. If they\\nshould get wind that shares in _The Ethiopian_ were to be bought in the\\nopen market, they would buy up every share in sight in an effort to gain\\ncontrol. Therefore it was necessary that business should be carried on\\nin a private manner, and as far as possible through channels of personal\\nfriendship rather than those of the City and the Stock Exchange.\\n\\nHe had studied my uncle carefully and was convinced that he was just the\\nman for the work. He proposed giving him a salary of one thousand pounds\\na year to act as his English agent, and a five-per-cent commission on\\nall sales of shares that he was instrumental in effecting. His chief\\nservice was to consist in supplying lists of names and addresses of\\nthe moneyed religious public, and in applying his influence to the\\nattracting of purchasers. The lists were of course to be culled mainly\\nfrom the contributors to the charitable societies of which he was\\nsecretary. In fact, what the proposal amounted to, as I see it now, was\\nthat my uncle’s integrity, well-known among religious circles, was to\\nguarantee the worth of the shares.\\n\\n“It’s a close secret, Dante,” my uncle said. “Rapson won’t let me tell\\nanyone, not even your Aunt Lavinia, the basis of our understanding.\\nBut I had to tell somebody; happiness isn’t happiness when you keep its\\nreason to yourself. So I’ve told you, because we’ve had so many secrets\\ntogether.”\\n\\nWe sat on, quite forgetful of time, watching the sleepy flowing of the\\nriver, building castles in the air. Last month they had declared their\\nhalf-yearly dividend and it had amounted to twenty per cent. Since\\nthen the sale of shares had quickened enormously. Why, there was one\\nmorning’s mail when my uncle’s commissions alone had amounted to fifty\\npounds. Think of that--and it was only the beginning! Then we commenced\\nto reckon how much he would have in five years, if his commissions\\namounted always to fifty pounds a morning, and he made a rule to spend\\nnothing but his salary. It was the old childish game which had first\\nmade us chummy, of so many hens laying so many eggs, and how much would\\nwe have at the end of a twelvemonth.\\n\\nHe could afford to joke now concerning the penury of his lean years\\nbefore the great Rapson had put in an appearance. He even made fun of\\nhis own _spuffing_, and laughed as he told me how much economy those\\nodd shillings and half-crowns, which he used to give me in such a large\\nmanner, had cost him.\\n\\n“But it’s all over now,” he said cheerfully, “and I’m going to be\\nan important man. People are beginning to look up to me already. Who\\nknows?--one day I may enter Parliament. I’m moving in a different social\\nset--Rapson’s friends. He’s very well-connected. They’re a little gay\\nand larky, you know; your Aunt Lavinia don’t quite know what to make of\\n’em. She’ll get over that. Oh, but it’s a big new world for me, Dante,\\nand there’s heaps of things to do in it that I never knew about.”\\n\\nOn our way back the great George Rapson himself met us, and we found\\nthat we’d been gone an hour. He told us that he’d ordered lunch at a\\nlittle inn, called _The White Cross_--one which hung over the river.\\n\\nHow proud I was to walk beside him as we re-entered Richmond! Everyone\\nturned to stare after him as he passed, with his long fawn coat open and\\nflapping, his easy rollicking laugh, his great height and distinguished\\npresence. And I, Dante Cardover, was by way of being the friend of such\\na man! The gates of romance were indeed opening.\\n\\n_The White Cross Inn_ had separate balconies, built out from each of\\nits second-story windows. In one of these our table was set. The little\\ntiger helped the maid of the inn to wait upon us. And what a meal we\\nhad!--salmon and salad and fowl, stuffed veal and pine-apple, dates,\\nalmonds, and raisins--everything that a boy could ask to have. Up the\\nwalls of the inn climbed rambler roses and tumbled over the sides of the\\nbalcony. Beneath us lay the river, like a silver snake, lazily uncurled,\\nsunning itself in great green meadows.\\n\\n“This is to be your day, Dante,” Mr. Rapson said. “We brought some of\\nthese things from London because we knew you liked ’em. You discovered\\nyour Uncle Obad before I did, and when no one else had. He’s told me all\\nabout it. Here’s your very good health.”\\n\\nThe tiger, who had been drawing the cork out of a large green bottle\\nabout half as tall as himself, now poured out a golden foamy liquid. I\\nfound one glass of it had the same care-freeing effect that the holding\\nof Fiesole’s hand in the summer-house had had. I felt myself at ease in\\nthe world, and began to speak of the Reverend Robert Sneard as “jolly\\nold Sneard,” and of all people who had authority over me with tolerant\\ncontempt. I gazed back from the security of my temporary Canaan, and\\ngave my entertainers a whimsical account of my perilous journey through\\nthe wilderness of boyhood. It was wonderful even to myself how suddenly\\nmy shyness had vanished.\\n\\nMr. Rapson seemed highly amused. “You’ll do, young’un,” he said.\\n\\nThen, little by little, he began to speak of Africa--the dust, the\\nKaffirs, and the wide, parched veldt. He spoke of adventures with lions\\nfar up in the interior, and of how he had once been an ivory-hunter\\nbefore he struck it lucky in the south. “I ran away from home when I was\\na youngster of twenty and all because of a girl.” He nodded at me wisely\\nacross the table, “Keep clear of the girlies, they’re the devil.”\\n\\nI thought of Fiesole and inquired if some girls weren’t quite attractive\\ndevils. My uncle looked shocked in a genial fashion at this very free\\nuse of a forbidden word--the fear of Aunt Lavinia purged his vocabulary\\neven when she was absent. But Mr. Rapson went red in the face and\\nsmacked his hands together, laughing loudly. “Of course they’re\\nattractive; else how’d they tempt us?”\\n\\nA punt, which had stolen up beneath our balcony, now caught his\\nattention. A girl in a gown of flowered muslin, with a broad pink sash\\nabout her waist, was standing in the stern. She was alone, and all the\\nriver formed a landscape for her daintiness.\\n\\nMr. Rapson stared hard at her; her back was towards us. “Seem to know\\nher hair,” he muttered. He half rose. “By George, it’s Kitty!”\\n\\nLeaning far out over the balcony he called to her impulsively, “Kitty!\\nKitty!”\\n\\nVery leisurely she lifted up to him a small flushed face, all laughter\\nand naughtiness, and waved her hand. She was as pretty as love and a\\nsummer’s day could make a woman--but I wasn’t supposed to be old enough\\nto observe such things as that.\\n\\nShe brought her punt in to the bank, while Mr. Rapson went down to help\\nher out. When he gave her his hand to steady her, she kept it in hers.\\nAs she glanced mischievously up at him I heard her say, “Why, George,\\nyou terror, who’d have thought of meeting you here!”\\n\\nHe whispered something to her with a frown; she dropped him a mocking\\ncourtesy.\\n\\nWhen he brought her up on to the balcony, he introduced her as his\\ncousin Kitty. She bowed to us with a roguish grace, clinging close to\\nhis arm. “Now, Kitty,” he said, freeing himself, “you’ve got to behave.”\\n\\nSeeing that my uncle was looking at her in a puzzled manner, she took\\nthe center of the stage without embarrassment, explaining, “Georgie and\\nI are very old friends and I’ve not seen him, oh, for ages.”\\n\\nWhen they had told her how they happened to be there and that it was my\\nday, and that they had stolen me away from my lessons, she swung round\\non me with a kind of rapture. “Oh, what darlings to do that! And what a\\nnice boy!” Without further ado she patted my face and kissed me. It was\\na new sensation. I blushed furiously, and was both pleased and abashed.\\n“You may be older than I am,” I thought; “but you’re only a girl. In\\nthree years I could marry you.”\\n\\nShe was like a happy little dog in a meadow; never still, sending up\\nbirds--following nothing and chasing everything. In her conversation she\\ngamboled about and never ceased gamboling. She didn’t sit quietly like\\nthe Snow Lady and all the other ladies of my acquaintance, putting in\\na word now and then, but letting the men do the talking. She made\\neverybody look at her--perhaps, because she was so well worth looking\\nat. Even before she had kissed me I was in love with her.\\n\\nMr. Rapson seemed a little nervous, and she appeared to delight in his\\nfear of her daring.\\n\\n“Georgie’s always had a passion for me,” she said, “though he won’t own\\nit.” Then suddenly, seeing the troubled expression on his face, “How\\nmuch has the poor dear told you about himself?”\\n\\nShe wriggled out of me something of the story of his doings. She eyed\\nhim archly from under her big hat and, when I had ended, leant across\\nthe table so their faces nearly met. “How many lions did my Georgie kill\\nin Africa?”\\n\\n“Be quiet, you little devil,” he laughed, seizing her by the hands.\\n\\nThe employment of that forbidden word set me wondering whether this was\\nthe girl for love of whom he first went wandering. But she looked too\\nyoung for that.\\n\\nWe went into her punt and drifted down the river with the current. She\\nplayed the madcap all the way, speaking to him often in baby language.\\nHe seemed to be amused by it, as a St. Bernard might be amused by the\\nimpertinence of a terrier. When she got too bold he would hold her hands\\nuntil she was quiet, overpowering her with his great strength much the\\nsame as he did his horses. Then she would turn her attentions to me for\\na time, and I would make believe to myself she was Fiesole. My uncle\\nlooked on like a benevolent Father Christmas, dignified and smiling.\\n\\nDusk was settling when we started on the return journey. We found that\\nwe had drifted further than we had intended. Mr. Rapson took the pole\\nand did the punting. Miss Kitty sang to him, she said to encourage him.\\nI think it must have been then that I first heard _Twickenham Ferry_.\\nShe had to leave off part way through the last verse I remember. She\\nsaid that the mist from the river choked her; but I, lying on the\\ncushions beside her, somehow gathered the impression that she was nearly\\ncrying. When she broke down, under cover of darkness I got my hand into\\nhers, and then she slipped her arm about me. After that she was very\\nsubdued and silent. My uncle fell off to sleep, and Mr. Rapson kept his\\nface turned away from us, busy with his punting. I wondered if, after\\nall, Miss Kitty was happy.\\n\\nIt was night when we arrived. She insisted on parting with us at the\\nlanding, saying that her houseboat was just across the river and she\\ncould take the punt home quite well unaccompanied. We had said good-by\\nand were walking along the quay, when Rapson left us and ran back. I saw\\nhim come close and bend over her. They seemed to be whispering together.\\nThen she pushed out into the river; the lights of the town held her for\\na time; darkness closed in behind her and she vanished.\\n\\nOn the drive back to the Red House I grew drowsy.\\n\\nI tried to keep my eyes open, but even the soft moonlight seemed\\ndazzling. The meadows and tall trees stealing by, ceased to stand out\\nseparate, but became a blur. The sharp _trit-trot, trit-trot_ of the\\nhorses’ hoofs on the hard macadam road lulled me by their monotonous\\nregularity.\\n\\nWhen I came to myself I heard my uncle saying, “I like that little\\ncousin of yours, Rapson; she’s charming and different from any woman\\nthat I ever met.”\\n\\n“Daresay she is,” Rapson answered, dryly; “you’ve led such a sheltered\\nlife. Of course she isn’t my cousin.”\\n\\n“Who is she, then?”\\n\\n“Oh, a nymph.”\\n\\n“A nymph! You have the better of me there. That’s a classical allusion,\\nno doubt. I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“Never mind, papa,” Mr. Rapson said cheerfully; “I didn’t think you\\nwould understand. It’s just as well.”\\n\\nThen he commenced speaking to his horses. “So, girl! Steady there!\\nSteady!”\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes, and saw that we were ascending Eden Hill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII--MONEY AND HAPPINESS\\n\\nDeep down in their secret hearts all the Spuffler’s relations had felt\\nthat his permanent failure to get on in the world was a kind of disgrace\\nto themselves. They resented it, but as a rule kept quiet about it\\n“for the sake of poor Lavinia.” My aunt was always “poor Lavinia,” when\\nmentioned by her family. Before strangers, needless to say, they helped\\nhim to keep up his pretense of importance and spoke of him with respect.\\nBut the thought that a man who had intermarried with them, should have\\nlowered his wife to the keeping of a boarding-house rankled. Even as\\na child I was conscious that my close attachment to my uncle Obad was\\nregarded with disapprobation. He was the Ishmael of our tribe.\\n\\nAt first none of his relatives would believe in his mushroom prosperity.\\nPerhaps, they did not want to believe in it; it would entail the\\nsacrifice of life-long prejudices. They pooh-poohed it as the most\\nextravagant example of his fantastic spuffling. On my return home\\nfor the summer holidays I very soon became aware of an atmosphere of\\nhalf-humorous contempt whenever his name was mentioned. Once when I took\\nup the cudgels for him, declaring that he was really a great man, the\\nSnow Lady patted my hand gently, calling me “a blessed young optimist.”\\n My father, who rarely lost his temper, told me I was speaking on a\\nsubject concerning which I was profoundly ignorant.\\n\\nOn a visit to Charity Grove I was grieved to find that even Aunt Lavinia\\nwas skeptical. Despite the jingling of money in my uncle’s pockets, she\\ninsisted on living in the old proud hand-to-mouth fashion, making the\\nspending capacity of each penny go its furthest. Her house was still\\nunderstaffed in the matter of servants--servants who could be procured\\nat the lowest wages. She still did her shopping in the lower-class\\ndistricts, where men cried their wares on the pavement beneath flaring\\nnaphtha-lamps and slatternly women elbowed your ribs and mauled\\neverything with dirty hands before they purchased. Here housekeeping\\ncould be contrived on the smallest outlay of capital.\\n\\nUncle Obad might go to fashionable tailors; she clothed herself in\\nblack, because it wore longest and could be turned. She listened to his\\nlatest optimisms a little wearily with a sadly smiling countenance, as\\na mother might listen to the plans for walking of a child hopelessly\\ncrippled. She had heard him speak bravely so many, many times, and had\\nbeen disappointed, that she had permanently made up her mind that she\\nwould have to go on earning the living for both of them all her life.\\n\\nYet she loved him as well as a woman could a man for whom she was\\nonly sorry; she was constantly on the watch to defend him from the\\ndisapprobation of the world. But she refused ever again to be beguiled\\ninto believing that he would take his place with other men. So, when\\nhe told her that they didn’t need to keep on the boarding-house, she\\nscarcely halted long enough in her work to listen to him. And when he\\nsaid that he could now afford her a hundred pounds for dress, she bent\\nher head lower to hide a smile, for she didn’t want to wound him. And\\nwhen he brought her home a diamond bracelet, she tried to find out where\\nit had been purchased in order that she might return it on the quiet.\\n\\nGradually, however, she began to be persuaded that this time it wasn’t\\nall bluster. The gallantry of his attitude towards herself was the\\nunaccountable element. Not so long ago it had been she who was the man\\nabout the house, and he had been a kind of grown-up boy. Once she had\\nallowed him to kiss her; now he kissed her masterfully as by right of\\nconquest. He had become a man at last, after halting at the hobbledehoy\\nstage for fifty years. He treated her boldly as a lover, striving to\\ndraw out her womanhood. He was making up the long arrears of affection\\nwhich, up to this time, he had not felt himself worthy to display.\\n\\nOne evening in the garden he tore the bandage of doubt from her eyes. I\\nwas there when it happened. We were down in the paddock, the home of\\nthe fowls, where so many of our dreams had taken place. The gaunt London\\nhouses to the right of us were doing their best to shut out the sunset.\\nAunt Lavinia began to wonder how much the little hay-crop would fetch\\nthis year. She was disappointed because it had grown so thin, and there\\nseemed no promise of rain.\\n\\n“It doesn’t matter, my dear,” said my uncle cheerfully.\\n\\n“Obad, how can you say that!”\\n\\nHe pressed up to her flushing like a boy, placing his arms about her and\\nlifting her face. “Lavinia, are you never going to trust me?”\\n\\nThe sudden tenderness and reproach in his voice stabbed her heart into\\nwakefulness. When she spoke, her words came like a cry: “Oh, Obad, how I\\nwish I could believe it true this time!”\\n\\n“But it is true, my dearest.”\\n\\nI stole away, and did not see them again till an hour later when they\\nwandered by me arm-in-arm through the wistful twilight. Within a week I\\nknew that she had accepted his prosperity as a fact, for he gave her a\\nblue silk dress and she wore it. But he had harder work in getting\\nher to give up the boarding-house. His great argument was that Rapson\\nadvised it--it would advance their social standing. She fenced and\\nhesitated, but finally promised on the condition that he was still\\nsucceeding in November.\\n\\nI think it must have been the news of her surrender that sapped the last\\nfoundation of my father’s skepticism. At any rate, shortly after this,\\nwhen my uncle by special invitation came over to Pope Lane, he was given\\none of my father’s best cigars as befitted a rich relative. The best\\nglass and silver were put out. We all had unsoiled serviettes and\\nobserved uncomfortable company manners. In the afternoon he was carried\\noff to my father’s study and remained there till long past the tea-hour.\\n\\nLater my father told me the subject of their discussion. By dint of\\nhard saving he had put by two thousand pounds for planting me out in the\\nworld, part of which was to pay for my Oxford education. Having heard of\\nthat half-yearly twenty-per-cent dividend which the _Ethiopian_ shares\\nhad paid and that they were still being issued privately, at par value,\\nhe was inclined to entrust his money to my uncle, if he could prove the\\ninvestment sound. If the mines were as good as they appeared to be, he\\nwould get four hundred pounds a year in interest--which would make all\\nthe difference to our ease of life. There was another consultation; the\\nnext thing I knew the important step had been taken.\\n\\nAll our power of dreaming now broke loose. It became our favorite\\npastime to sit together and plan how we would spend the four hundred\\npounds.\\n\\n“Why, it’s an income in itself,” my father would exclaim; “I shall be\\nfreed forever from the drudgery of hack-work.”\\n\\nAnd the Snow Lady would say, “Now you’ll be able to turn your mind to\\nthe really important things of life--the big books which you’ve always\\nhoped to write.”\\n\\nAnd Ruthita would sidle up to him in her half-shy way, and rub her cheek\\nagainst his face, saying nothing.\\n\\nA wonderful kindliness nowadays entered into all our domestic relations.\\nMy father’s weary industry, which had sent us all tiptoeing about\\nthe house, began to relax. Even for him work lost something of its\\nsacredness now that money was in sight. He no longer frowned and refused\\nto look up if anyone trespassed into his study. On the contrary, he\\nseemed glad of the excuse for laying aside his pen and discussing what\\nplace in the whole wide world we should choose, when we were free to\\nlive where we liked.\\n\\nIt should be somewhere in Italy--Florence, perhaps. For years it had\\nbeen his unattainable dream to live among olive-groves of the Arno\\nvalley. We read up guide-books and histories about it. Soon we were\\nquite familiar with the Pitti Palace, the Ponte Vecchio, and the\\nview from the Viale dei Colli at sundown. These and many places with\\nbeautiful and large-sounding names, became the stock-in-trade of\\nour conversation. And the brave, looked-down-on Spuffler was the\\nfaery-godmother who had made these dreams realities.\\n\\nA tangible proof of the promised change in our financial status was\\nexperienced by myself on my return to school in a more liberal\\nallowance of pocket-money. As yet it was only a promised change, for the\\nhalf-yearly dividend would not be declared until January, and would not\\nbe paid till a month later.\\n\\nWhat one might call “a reflected proof” came when we went over to spend\\nChristmas with Uncle Obad at Chelsea.\\n\\nYes, Aunt Lavinia had succumbed to her good fortune. The Christian\\nBoarding House had been abandoned and a fine old house had been rented,\\nstanding nearly at the corner of Cheyne Row, looking out across the\\nriver to Battersea.\\n\\nOn Christmas Eve my uncle’s carriage came to fetch us. That was a\\nsurprise in itself. It was his present to Aunt Lavinia, all brand new--a\\nroomy brougham, with two gray horses, and a coachman in livery. From\\nthis it will be seen that he had not kept his bargain with himself, made\\nthat day at Richmond, to live only on his salary.\\n\\nA slight fall of snow was on the ground; across London we drove, the\\nmerriest little family in all that shopping crowd. We had scarcely\\npulled up against the pavement and had our first peep of the fine big\\nhouse, when the front-door flew open, letting out a flood of light\\nwhich rippled to the carriage like a golden carpet unrolled across white\\nsatin.\\n\\nThere stood Uncle Obad, frock-coated and glorious, with Aunt Lavinia\\nbeside him, dressed all in lavender--not at all the prim, businesslike\\nlittle woman, half widow, half hospital nurse, of my earliest\\nrecollection. She was as beaming and excited as a young girl, and\\ngreeted the Snow Lady by throwing her arms about her and whispering,\\n“Oh, doesn’t it seem all too good to be true?”\\n\\nThe Snow Lady kissed her gaily on both cheeks, saying, “True enough, my\\ndear. At any rate, Obad’s carriage was very real.”\\n\\nHow changed we were from the solemn polite personages who had considered\\nit a point in our favor that we knew how to bottle our emotions. We\\nlaughed and rollicked, and made quite poor jokes seem brilliant by the\\nsparkle with which we told or received them. And all this was done\\nby money; in our case, merely by the promise of money! When a boy\\nremembered what we all had been, it was a transformation which called\\nfor reflection.\\n\\nMy uncle with his jolly rich-relative manner was the focus-point of our\\nattentions. Aunt Lavinia and, in fact, we all felt flat whenever he went\\nout of the room. She followed after him like a little dog, with dumb\\nadmiring eyes, waiting to be petted. She told the Snow Lady that she\\ncouldn’t blame herself enough and could never make it up to him, for\\nhaving lived with him in the same house all those years without having\\ndiscovered his goodness. Then, as ladies will, they kissed for the\\ntwentieth time and did a little glad crying together.\\n\\nSo the stern grayness, which comes of a too frequent pondering on a\\ndiminishing bank-account, had vanished from the faces of our elders.\\nRuthita and I looked on and wondered. A great house had something to\\ndo with it, and heavy carpets, and wide fire-places, and fine shiny\\nfurniture, but underlying it all was money.\\n\\nChristmas Eve I was awakened by the playing of waits outside my window.\\nI looked out at the broad black river, with the ropes of stars, which\\nwere the lights of bridges, flung across it. And I looked at the\\nuntrodden snow, stretching far down the Embankment, gleaming and\\nshadowy, making London seem a far-away, forgotten country. Then fumbling\\nin the darkness, I looked in my stocking and drew out a slip of paper.\\nBy the light of a match, I discovered it to be a check from my aunt and\\nuncle for fifty pounds. Comparing notes in my night-gown with Ruthita\\nnext morning, I found that she had another for the same amount.\\n\\nAh, but that was something like a Christmas! Never a twenty-fifth of\\nDecember comes round but I remember it. My father summed it all up when\\nhe said, “Well, Obad, now you’ve struck it lucky, you certainly know how\\nto be generous.”\\n\\nHe certainly did, and proved amply that only poverty had prevented him\\nin former days from being the best loved man in the family. Only one\\nperson roused more admiration than my uncle, and that was Mr. Rapson.\\nMy father had never met him, so he had been invited to the Christmas\\ndinner. At the last moment he had excused himself, saying that he had\\nan unavoidable engagement with a lady. However, he turned up late in the\\nevening with Miss Kitty on his arm and a fur-coat on his back. Somehow\\nthey both seemed articles of clothing; he wore them with such perfect\\nassurance, as though they were so much a part of himself. In the hall he\\ntook off his fur-coat, and then he had only Miss Kitty to wear.\\n\\nIt was awe-inspiring to see the deference that was paid him and the ease\\nwith which he accepted every attention. My father, with the sincerest\\nsimplicity, almost thanked him to his face for selling him _The\\nEthiopian_ shares.\\n\\nOf course he had to tell his lion-stories and how he went hunting\\nivory in Africa. My uncle trotted him about as though he were a horse,\\nreminding him of all his paces. Mr. Rapson was _his_ discovery--_his_\\nproperty. We all sat round and hero-worshiped. Miss Kitty seemed\\noverwhelmed by the greatness of the house and the general luxury.\\n\\nShe appeared particularly shy of the ladies. After she had gone they\\ndeclared her to be a dumb, doll-like little creature, with her quiet\\neyes and honey- hair. I sniggered, and they said, “What’s the\\nmatter with the boy? Why are you gurgling, Dante?”\\n\\nI was thinking of another occasion, when she was neither dumb nor\\ndoll-like.\\n\\nNow, quite contrary to her behavior at Richmond, she remained almost\\nmotionless on the chair in which Mr. Rapson had placed her, looking like\\na beautiful obedient piece of jewelry, waiting till her owner got ready\\nto claim her. Only at parting did she show me any sign of recollection\\nand then, while all eyes were occupied with Mr. Rapson, she whispered,\\n“You were good to me at Richmond. I don’t forget.”\\n\\nWe stayed with my uncle four days. To us children it was a kind of\\ntragedy when we left. “We must do this every year,” my uncle said.\\n\\n“If we ar’n’t in Florence,” my father replied gaily.\\n\\nGoing back to school this time was a sore trial--it meant moving out\\nof the zone of excitement. It seemed that every day something new must\\nhappen; and then there was so much to talk about. However, I got my\\npleasure another way--by the things I let out at school, with a boy’s\\nnatural boastfulness, about my uncle. I found myself, what I had always\\ndesired to be, genuinely and extremely popular. Money again! I let them\\nknow that they would probably only have the privilege of my society for\\na little while as, in all likelihood, I should be living in Florence\\nnext year.\\n\\nThis term two events happened, intimately related to one another in\\ntheir effect upon my career, though at the time no one could have\\nsuspected any connection between them.\\n\\nLady Zion, the Creature’s sister, had certainly got more crazy in the\\nyears that had elapsed since I first met her. The winter was a heavy\\none and the snow fell far into February; yet nothing could restrain her,\\nshort of an asylum, from wandering about in the bleakest weather all\\nover the countryside. Sometimes she would stay out far into the night,\\nand on several occasions the Creature and I had to go out and search for\\nher. I have seen her pass me five miles from home, riding on her little\\nass, talking to herself, all unaware of anything around her.\\n\\nShe was a temptation to the village-boys, and they would frequently\\ntorment her. The antagonism between the Red House and the village ran\\nhigh. In a sense she was school property; we would make a chance of\\nrescuing her an excuse for a free-fight. This meant that when the enemy\\nfound her alone, they took the opportunity of displaying their spite.\\n\\nOn the fourteenth of February she had been out all day. No one had seen\\nher; by nightfall she had not returned. The Creature got permission to\\nhave me go out with him to hunt for her. It was necessary that someone\\nshould go with him because he was short-sighted. We investigated all her\\nfavorite haunts, but found not a trace of her. We inquired of farmers\\nand travelers on the road, but heard nothing satisfactory. If she had\\ngone by field-routes this was not remarkable, for all the country was\\ncovered with snow. Her white draped figure against the white landscape\\nmade it easy for her to escape observation.\\n\\nThe poor old Creature was getting worried; we had been three hours\\nsearching and hadn’t got a clue. I did my best to cheer him, and at last\\nproposed that we should return to his cottage as sometimes the donkey\\nhad brought her back of himself.\\n\\nFrom the point where we then stood our shortest route lay cross-country\\nthrough a wood, skirting a little dell. Under the trees it was very dark\\nalthough the moon was shining, for the trees grew close together. We\\nwere passing by the dell when I happened to look aside. The moonlight,\\nfalling across it, showed me something standing there. I asked the\\nCreature to wait while I went and examined it. As I got nearer, I saw it\\nwas alive; then I recognized Lady Zion’s donkey. It had halted over what\\nappeared to be a drift of snow. On coming closer I saw that it was Lady\\nZion herself. Something warned me not to call her brother.\\n\\nBending down, I turned her over and drew the straggling hair from off\\nher face. There was a red gash in her forehead and red upon the snow. By\\nthe fear that seized me when I touched her, I knew.\\n\\nComing back to the Creature I told him it was nothing--I had been\\nmistaken. At the school-house I made an excuse to leave him while he\\nwent on to the cottage. When he was out of sight I ran panic-stricken\\nto Sneard’s study and told him. The two of us, without giving the alarm,\\nreturned to the wood and brought her home. The Creature was just setting\\nout again when we reached the cottage. By the limp way in which she hung\\nacross the donkey’s back, he realized at a glance what had happened.\\nCatching her in his arms, he dragged her down on to the road and,\\nkneeling over her, commenced to sob and sob like an animal, not using\\nany words, in a low moaning monotone.\\n\\nOne by one windows in the village-street were thrown open; frowsy heads\\nstuck out; lights began to grope across the panes; the sleeping houses\\nwoke and a promiscuous crowd of half-clad people gathered. Above the\\nintermittent babel of questions and answers was the constant sound of\\nthe Creature’s sobbing.\\n\\nNext morning the news of Lady Zion’s death was common property.\\nDetectives came down from London and a thorough effort was made to trace\\nthe murderer. Near the spot in the dell where she had been discovered,\\nhalf-a-dozen snowballs lay scattered. It was supposed that a village-boy\\nhad come across her there, and in one of the snowballs he had thrown,\\npurposely or accidentally, had buried a stone; then, seeing her fall,\\nhad run away in terror.\\n\\nAt the school various rumors went the round. The one which found most\\nfavor, though we all knew it to be untrue, was that Sneard had done\\nit. His supposed motive was his well-known annoyance at Lady Zion’s\\nirritating obsession that he had once loved her.\\n\\nIn the midst of this excitement, while the London detectives were\\nstill hunting, I received a telegram from my father, unexplained and\\nperemptory, “_Return immediately. Bring all belongings._”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX--THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES\\n\\nOf course the telegram was connected in some way with the payment of the\\nfirst half-yearly dividend. Perhaps my father had decided on an instant\\nremoval to Italy. So my schoolmates thought as they stood enviously\\nwatching me pack.\\n\\nTowards evening I stepped into the village’s one and only cab. I shook\\nthe dust of the Red House from my feet without regret. With the\\nintense selfishness of youth, my own hope for the future made me almost\\nforgetful of the Creature’s tragedy.\\n\\nIt was about eight o’clock when I reached Pope Lane. All the front of\\nthe house was in darkness. I tugged vigorously at the bell, feeling a\\nlittle slighted that none of them had been on the look-out. Directly\\nthe door opened, I rushed in with a mouthful of excited questions. Hetty\\nstared at me disapprovingly. “Don’t make so much noise, Master Dante,”\\n she said; “your mother and Miss Ruthita ’ave ’ad a worryin’ day and\\n’ave gorn to bed. They didn’t know you was comin’.”\\n\\nI noticed that the stairway was unlighted, that the gas in the hall was\\non the jet, and that Hetty herself was partly prepared for bed. I was\\nbeginning to explain to her about the telegram, speaking below my breath\\nthe way one does when death is in the house. Just then my father came\\nout from his study. His pen was behind his ear and his shoulders looked\\nstoopy. His face had the worn expression of the old days, which came\\nfrom overwork.\\n\\n“Father, why did you send for me?”\\n\\nHe led me into the study, closing the door behind him.\\n\\n“You’ve got to be brave.”\\n\\nAt his words my heart sank. My eyes retreated from his face. I wanted to\\nlengthen out the minutes until I should know the worst.\\n\\n“My boy, your Uncle Obad’s gone to smash. We’ve lost everything.”\\n\\nHe seated himself at the table, his head supported on his hand. He had\\ntried to speak in a matter-of-fact manner, as much as to say, “Of course\\nthis is just what we all expected.” But I could see that hope had\\ngone out of him. I wanted to say something decent and comforting; but\\neverything that came to me seemed too grandiloquent. There was nothing\\nadequate that could be said. Florence, realization of dreams, respite\\nfrom drudgery--all the happiness that money alone could purchase and\\nthat had seemed so accessible, was now placed apparently forever beyond\\nreach of his hand.\\n\\nHe took his pen from behind his ear and commenced aimlessly stabbing the\\nblotting-pad.\\n\\nHe spoke again, looking away from me. “That money was yours. I saved it\\nfor you. It was for giving you a chance in the world. I ought to have\\nknown that your uncle wasn’t to be trusted--he’s never been able to earn\\na living by honest work. But there, I don’t blame him as much as I blame\\nmyself. I must have been mad.”\\n\\n“Shan’t we get anything back?”\\n\\nHe shook his head. “This fellow Rapson is a common swindler, from what\\nI can make out. He simply used your uncle. He may never have had any\\ndiamond mines. If he had, they were worthless. He doesn’t appear to have\\nhad any capital except what he got by your uncle selling his shares. He\\npaid his one dividend last summer in order to tempt investors, and now\\nhe’s decamped. We shan’t see a penny back.”\\n\\nI tried to tell him that he needn’t worry for my sake--I could work.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” he said, “that’s why I sent for you. Of course your fees are\\nall paid for this term; but if you’ve got to enter the commercial world,\\nthe sooner the better. You’ve come to an age when every day spent at\\nschool is a day wasted, unless you’re going to enter a profession. You\\ncan’t get a University education without money and, in any case, it’s\\nworse than valueless unless you have the money to back it.”\\n\\n“But I don’t mind working,” I assured him; “I shall be glad to work.\\nP’raps by starting early I’ll be able to earn a lot of money and help\\nyou one day, Dad.”\\n\\nHe frowned at my cheerfulness; he had finished with optimism forever.\\n“You don’t know what you’re saying. Money isn’t so easily earned. It\\ntook me fifteen years of pinching and scraping to save two thousand\\npounds.” Then, conscious of ungraciousness, he added, “But I like your\\nspirit, Dante, and it was good of you to say that.”\\n\\nHis fear of heroics and sentiment made him rise quickly and turn out the\\nlamp.\\n\\n“Best go to bed.”\\n\\nI groped my way upstairs through the darkened house. There was\\nsomething unnatural about its darkness. Its silence was not the silence\\nof a house in which people were sleeping, but one in which they lay\\nwithout rest staring into the shadows. In my bedroom I felt it indecent\\nto light the gas. I sat by the window, looking out across gardens to\\nour neighbors’ illumined windows. Someone was playing a piano; it seemed\\ndisgustingly bad taste on their part to do that when we had lost two\\nthousand pounds.\\n\\nMy thought veered round. What after all were two thousand pounds to\\nbe so miserable about! I began to feel annoyed with my father that he\\nshould have made such a fuss about it. I was sure that neither the Snow\\nLady nor Ruthita had wanted to go to bed so early. Probably he didn’t\\nreally want to himself. He just got the idea into his head, and had\\nforced it on the family. In our house, until Mr. Rapson came along, it\\nhad always been like that: he punished us, instead of the people who had\\nhurt him, by the moods that resulted from his disappointments. Why, if\\nit was simply a matter of my going to work, I rather liked the prospect.\\nAnyhow, it was for the most part my concern. And then I remembered how\\nsad he had looked, and was sorry that such thoughts had come into my\\nhead.\\n\\nA tap at my door made me jump up conscience-stricken. “It’s only\\nRuthita,” a low voice said.\\n\\nShe crept in noiselessly as a shadow. Her warm arms went about my\\nneck, drawing my face down to hers. “Oh, Dannie, I’m so, so sorry,” she\\nwhispered.\\n\\n“What about?”\\n\\n“Because I’ve never missed welcoming you home ever since you went to\\nschool, and you needed me most of all this evening--and because you’ve\\ngot to go to work.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter, Ruthie. If I go to work I’ll earn money, and then\\nI’ll be able to do things for you.”\\n\\n“For me! Oh, you darling!” Then she thought a minute and her face\\nclouded. “But no, if you go to work you’ll marry. That’s what always\\nhappens.”\\n\\nShe stood gazing up at me, her face looking frailer and purer than ever\\nin the darkness. She had slipped on a long blue dressing-gown to come\\nand see me, and her long black hair hung loose about her. Just below the\\nedge of her gown her small pale feet showed out. Then I realized for\\nthe first time that she had changed as I had changed; we were no longer\\nchildren. Perhaps the same wistful imaginings, exquisite and alluring,\\nhad come to her. For her also the walls of childhood, which had shut out\\nthe far horizon, were crumbling. Then, with an overwhelming reverence, I\\nbecame aware of the strange fascination of her appealing beauty.\\n\\nShe snuggled herself beside me in the window. We spoke beneath our\\nbreath in the hushed voices of conspirators, lest we should be heard by\\nmy father.\\n\\n“I couldn’t sleep,” she said apologetically. “I was lonely, so I came to\\nyou. Everything and everybody seem so sad.”\\n\\n“It was your thoughts that were sad, Ruthie. What were you thinking\\nabout?”\\n\\nShe rubbed her cheek against mine shyly and I felt her tremble. “I\\nwas thinking about you. We’re growing up, Dante. You may go away and\\nforget--forget all about me and the Snow Lady.”\\n\\n“I shan’t,” I denied stoutly.\\n\\nTo which she replied, “But people do.”\\n\\n“Do what?”\\n\\n“Forget. And then I’m not your sister really--only by pretense.”\\n\\n“Look here,” I said, “you say that when boys earn money they marry. I\\ndon’t think I ever shall because--well, because of something that has\\nhappened. So why shouldn’t you and I agree to live always together, the\\nsame as we do now?”\\n\\nShe said that that would be grand; she would be a little mother to me.\\nBut she wanted to know what made me so sure that I would always be a\\nbachelor. With the sincere absurdity of youth, the more absurd because\\nof its sincerity, I confided my passion for Fiesole. “After what she\\nhas done,” I said, “I could never marry her; and yet I love her too well\\never to marry anybody else. I can only love golden hair now, and the\\ngolden hair of another girl would always remind me of Fiesole.”\\n\\nRuthita was silent. Then I remembered that her hair was black and saw\\nthat I had been clumsy in my sentiment, so I added, “But, Ruthie, in a\\nsister I think black hair is the prettiest color in the world.”\\n\\nAfter she had tiptoed away to her room and I had crept into bed, I lay\\nawake thinking over her words--that she was only my sister by pretense.\\n\\nNext day my father called me to him. “You had fifty pounds given you\\nlast Christmas. I want you to let me have it.”\\n\\nI supposed that he wanted me to lend it to him, so I gave him my book\\nand we went together to the savings bank and drew it out. I noticed that\\nhe drew out Ruthita’s fifty pounds as well. We climbed on to the top of\\nan omnibus; nothing was said about where we were going.\\n\\nHe had bought a paper and I read it across his arm as we journeyed.\\nAs he turned over from the first page my eye caught a column headed\\nDISAPPEARANCE OF GEORGE RAPSON. Underneath was a complete account of the\\nwhole affair.\\n\\nMy uncle had been interviewed by a reporter and had given a generously\\nindiscreet history of the catastrophe from beginning to end. He tried to\\ndefend Rapson, and by his own innocent disclosures pilloried himself\\nas a sanguine, gullible old ass. He insisted on believing in Rapson’s\\nintegrity. Things looked queer of course, but sooner or later there\\nwould be an explanation, satisfactory to everybody. What the nature of\\nthat explanation was likely to be he could not tell, but he hoped for\\nthe best. He was reported as having said that Mr. Rapson had repeatedly\\nreferred to secret enemies in the financial world. This was the reason\\nhe had given to Mr. Spreckles for not disposing of his shares through\\nthe ordinary channels.\\n\\nMr. Spreckles stated in his interview that, on the evening of the third\\nof January, Rapson had called at his house. He seemed excited and said\\nthat certain plots were culminating against his interests which made an\\ninstant and secret visit to South Africa essential. He had not hinted at\\nanything definitely serious, but, on the contrary, had given orders for\\nthe declaration of the half-yearly dividend, payment of which would\\nnot fall due till February. That evening he had disappeared; since then\\nnothing had been heard of him. When four weeks later Mr. Spreckles drew\\nchecks on Rapson’s bank-account for payment of the dividends, they were\\nall returned to him dishonored. A month previously, on the morning of\\nJanuary the third, Rapson had withdrawn every penny.\\n\\nAll the names of the people who had lost money in the adventure were\\nappended. For the most part they were wealthy widows and spinsters,\\nheavy contributors to various philanthropies, just the kind of people\\nwho would lack the business judgment which would have prevented them\\nfrom entering into such a gamble. My father’s name was the exception,\\nand was given special attention, being headed _A Hard Case_. “Mr.\\nCardover, having endured in his early life the humiliations and\\nstruggles which not infrequently fall to the lot of an ambitious\\npenniless young man, had determined that his son, Dante, should not\\nsuffer a like embittering experience. To this end he had saved two\\nthousand pounds to start his son on a professional career. This boy was\\nMr. Spreckles’ favorite nephew. Mr. Spreckles quotes the fact that it\\nwas he who induced Mr. Cardover to invest this money in _The Ethiopian\\nDiamond Mines_ as proof of his own honest belief in the value of the\\nshares. The boy will probably now have to be withdrawn from the Red\\nHouse, where he is being educated. Was it likely, Mr. Spreckles asked,\\nthat he would have been a party to the ruin of those whom he loved best,\\nif he had for a moment suspected that the investment was not all that it\\nwas represented?”\\n\\nI had proceeded so far with my reading, when my father crushed the paper\\nviciously into a ball and tossed it over the side of the bus. For the\\nfirst time within my remembrance I heard him swear. He was so overcome\\nwith irritation that he had to alight and walk it off. He kept throwing\\nout jerky odds and ends of exclamations, speaking partly to me, partly\\nto himself.\\n\\n“The bungling ass!”\\n\\n“Why did he need to drag our names into it?”\\n\\n“A regular windbag!”\\n\\n“First picks my pocket, then advertises my poverty. Thinks that he\\ncan prove himself honest by doing that!” I put in a feeble word for my\\nuncle, hinting that he didn’t mean any harm and that it was easy to be\\nwise after the event.\\n\\n“That’s the worst of people like your Uncle Spreckles,” my father\\nretorted hotly; “they never do mean any harm, and yet they’re always\\ngetting into interminable messes.” The storm worked itself out; we\\nclimbed on to another bus. At the end of an hour the streets became\\nfamiliar, and I knew that we were nearing Chelsea.\\n\\nWe got down within a stone’s throw of my uncle’s house. There it stood\\noverlooking the river, shut in with its wrought-iron palings, red and\\ncomfortable, and outwardly prosperous as when we had parted on its\\nsteps, promising to come again next Christmas if we weren’t in Florence.\\nBut when we attempted to enter, we had proof that its outward\\nappearance was a sham. The glory had departed, and with it had gone the\\nwhite-capped servants.\\n\\nThe door was opened to us on the chain. A slatternly kitchen-maid peered\\nout through the crack. She commenced to address us at once in a voice of\\nhigh-pitched, impudent defiance.\\n\\n“Wot yer want? Mr. Spreckles ain’t ’ere, I tell yer. Yer the fortieth\\nparty this mornin’ that’s come nosin’ rawnd. D’ye think I’ve got nothin’\\nter do ’cept run up and darn stairs h’answering bells? It’s a shime\\nthe waie yer all piles inter one man. I calls it disgustin’. A better\\nmaster a girl never ’ad.”\\n\\nI loved her for those words. They were the first that I had heard spoken\\nin my uncle’s defense. She was uttering all the pent up anger and sense\\nof injustice that I had been too cowardly to express. Even on my father\\nher fierce working-class loyalty to the under-dog had its effect.\\n\\n“My good girl,” he said, “you mustn’t talk to me like that. I’m Mr.\\nCardover, who was staying here last Christmas.”\\n\\nHer manner changed audibly, literally audibly, at his tone of implied\\nsympathy. She boo-hooed unrestrainedly as she slipped back the chain,\\npermitting us to enter.\\n\\n“I begs yer pardon, Mr. Cardover,” she sniveled, dusting her eyes with\\nher dirty apron. “I’m kind o’ unnerved. My poor dear master’s got so\\nmany h’enemies nar; I didn’t rekernize yer as ’is friend. Yer see, the\\nmoment this ’ere ’appened all the other servants left like a pack o’\\nrats. They didn’t love ’im the waie I did; I come along wiv ’im\\nfrom the boardin’ ’arse. This mornin’ ’e gives me notice, ’e did.\\n‘Car’line, I carn’t pay yer no more wyges,’ ’e says. ‘Gawd bless yer,’\\nsays I, ‘an’ if yer carn’t, wot does that matter? I ain’t one of yer\\n’igh and mighty, lawdy-dah hussies that I should desert yer.’ Oh,\\nMr. Cardover, it’s a shime the loife they’re leadin’ the poor man.\\nBut there, if they sends ’im to prison, I’ll never agen put me nose\\nh’insoide a church nor say no prayers. I’ll just believe there ain’t no\\nGawd in the world. The landlord, ’e’s in there h’at present wiv’im,\\na-naggin’ at ’im. I was listenin’ at the key’ole when yer rang the\\nbell. But there, I’m keepin’ yer witin’! Won’t yer step into the drarin’\\nroom till ’e’s by ’imself? H’excuse me dirty ’ands. I ’as to do\\nh’everythin’ for ’im--there’s only me and the master; even the Missis\\n’as left.”\\n\\nAs she was closing the door behind her, my father called after her,\\n“Mrs. Spreckles left! That’s astounding. Why has she done that?”\\n\\nThe tousled hair and red eyes re-appeared for a second. “Gorn back to\\nstart up the bo-ordin’ ’arse,” she stammered with a sob.\\n\\nHow different the room looked from when we were last in it! The cushions\\non the sofa were awry. The windows winked at you wickedly, one blind\\nlowered and the other up. It had the bewildered, disheveled swaggerness\\nof a last night’s reveler betrayed by the sunrise.\\n\\nSince Caroline had spoken my mind out for me, I felt awkward alone with\\nmy father. I was afraid of what he might say presently.\\n\\nI picked up a small, handsomely bound volume from the table while\\nwe were waiting. I began turning the pages, and found that it was\\na collected edition of tracts, written by my uncle and ostensibly\\naddressed to young men. They had been a kind of stealthy advertisement\\nof The Christian Boarding-House, calculated to make maiden aunts, into\\nwhose hands they fell, sit up and feel immediately that the author\\nwas the very person for influencing the morals of their giddy nephews.\\nThrough the persuasive saintliness expressed in these tracts Uncle Obad\\nhad procured many of his paying-guests. My eye was arrested by the\\ntitle of one of them, THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES. I read, “One of our\\ngreatest poets has written of finding love in huts where poor men lie.\\nOh, that young men might be brought to ponder the truth contained in\\nthose words! What is more difficult to obtain than love in the whole\\nworld? Can riches buy love? Nay, but on the contrary love and wealth are\\nrarely found together. Many a powerful financier and belted earl would\\ngive all that he has in exchange for love. Young men, when you come\\nto die, which of all your possessions can you carry with you to an\\nafter-world? Then, at least, you will learn the deceitfulness of riches.\\nYou thought you had everything; too late you know that you had nothing.\\nEven in this life some men live to learn that gold is but a phantom--a\\nvampire phantom destroying friendship.”\\n\\nI had got so far when footsteps and voices, loud in contention, sounded\\nin the hall. “You’ve got to be out of here in a fortnight, d’yer\\nunderstand? You’re letting down my property the longer you stay here.\\nYou’re giving my house a bad name. The address is in all the papers;\\npeople are already pointing it out. I won’t stand it. That’s my last\\nword.”\\n\\nThe front door slammed. I heard the chain being put up. The handle of\\nthe drawing-room door turned hesitatingly and my uncle entered. He still\\nwore the clothes of affluence, and yet the impression he made was one of\\nshabbiness. He seemed to have shrunk. His jolly John Bull confidence\\nhad vanished and had been replaced by the hurried, appeasing manner of a\\nsolicitor of charity. He avoided our eyes and commenced talking at once,\\npresumably to prevent my father from talking. He did not offer to shake\\nhands. “Well, Cardover, this is good of you. I hardly expected it. And,\\n’pon my word, there’s Dante. I’ve been having a worried time of it.\\nI’m a badly misunderstood man. But there, adversity has one advantage:\\nit teaches us who _are_ our friends. When the little storm has blown\\nover I shall know who to drop from my acquaintance. This sudden\\ndeparture of Rapson has had a very unfortunate effect--most\\nunfortunate. I expect a letter from him by every mail; then I’ll be able\\nto explain matters. A good fellow, Rapson. A capital fellow. As straight\\nas they make ’em. One of the best. Still, I wish he’d told me more\\nof his movements; for the moment affairs are a trifle awkward, I must\\nconfess.”\\n\\nHe mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and sank down on the sofa\\nwith the air of one who, being among pleasant companions, brushes aside\\nunpleasant topics. “Well, how’s Dante?” he asked, turning to me, “and\\nhow’s the Red House?”\\n\\nI didn’t know how to answer. The question seemed so inappropriate and\\nirrelevant. All the kindness which lay between us made such conversation\\na cruel farce. I wanted to tell him how sorry I was, and yet I daren’t\\nin my father’s presence. I realized that such cheeriness on my uncle’s\\npart was an insult, and yet I understood its motive.\\n\\nMy father’s face had hardened. He had expected some apology, some sign\\nof humility, or at least some direct appeal to his sympathy. If any of\\nthese things had happened after what Caroline had said, I believe he\\nwould have responded. But this insincere praise of the archculprit and\\nostrich-like refusal to face facts simply angered him. He rose to his\\nfeet with the restrained impatience of a just man; the drawn sternness\\nof his mouth was terrible. His voice had a steely coldness that pierced\\nthrough all pretenses.\\n\\n“Stop this nonsense, Obad,” he said sharply. “Don’t you realize that\\nyou’ve ruined me? Won’t you ever play the man? You know very well that\\nRapson will never come back, unless the police bring him. You’ve been\\nthe tool of a conspiracy to swindle the public; it was your religious\\nstanding that made the swindle possible. No one’s called you a thief as\\nyet, but that’s what everyone’s thinking. I know you’re not a thief, but\\nyou’ve been guilty of the grossest negligence. Can’t you bring home\\nto yourself the disgrace of that? You’ve always been a shirker of\\nresponsibility. For years you’ve let your wife do all the work. And now,\\nwhen through your silly optimism you’ve brought dishonor on the family,\\nyou still persist in hiding behind shams. I tell you, Obad, you’re a\\ncoward; you’re trying to evade the moral consequences of your actions.\\nIf you can’t feel shame now, you must be utterly worthless. Your\\nattitude is an offense against every right-thinking man. I didn’t set\\nout this morning with the intention of speaking to you like this. But\\nyour present conduct and that idiotic interview in the newspapers have\\nmade me alter my mind about you. To many men they would prove you nearly\\nas big a rascal as Rapson.”\\n\\nMy uncle had sat with his body crouched forward, his knees apart, his\\nhands knitted together, and his eyes fixed on the carpet while my father\\nhad been talking. Now that there was silence he did not stir. I watched\\nthe bald spot on his head, how the yellow skin crinkled and went tight\\nagain as he bunched up and relaxed his brows. He looked so kindly and\\nyet so ineffectual. My father had flayed him naked with his words. He\\nhad accused him of not being a man; but that was why I loved him. It was\\nhis unworldliness that had made it possible for him to penetrate so\\nfar into a child’s world. Caroline snuffled on the other side of the\\nkeyhole.\\n\\nMy uncle pulled apart his hands and raised his head. “You’ve said some\\nharsh things, Cardover. You’ve reminded me about Lavinia; I didn’t need\\nto be told that. I may be a fool, but I’m not a scoundrel. I can only\\nsay that I’m sorry for what’s happened. I was well-meaning; I did it for\\nthe best. Is there anything else you want to tell me?”\\n\\n“There’s just this.” My father handed him an envelope. “It may help you\\nto do the right thing in paying the investors a little of what’s left.\\nOf course you’ll have to sell off everything and pay them as much as you\\ncan.\\n\\n“But what is this you’ve given me?”\\n\\n“The hundred pounds you gave to Dante and Ruthita at Christmas.”\\n\\nHe flushed crimson; then the blood drained away from his hands and face,\\nleaving them ashy gray. His lip trembled, so that I feared terribly he\\nwas going to cry with the bitterness of his humiliation.\\n\\n“But--but it was a gift to them. I didn’t expect this. Won’t you let\\nthem keep it? I should like them to keep it. It’ll make so little\\ndifference to the whole amount.”\\n\\n“My dear Obad, when will you appreciate the fact that everything you\\nhave given away or have, is the result of another man’s theft?”\\n\\nMy uncle glanced round the room furtively, taking in the meaning of\\nthose words. It had been my father’s purpose to make him ashamed; that\\nwas amply accomplished now. He huddled back into the sofa, a broken man.\\nHe had been stabbed through his affections into a knowledge of reality.\\n\\nMy father beckoned to me and turned. I stretched out my hand and touched\\nmy uncle. He took no notice. The sunlight streamed in on the creased\\nbald head, the dust, and the forfeited splendor. Reluctantly I tiptoed\\nout and was met in the hall by the hot indignant eyes of Caroline,\\naccusing me of treachery across the banisters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X--THE LAST OF THE RED HOUSE\\n\\nIn after years it became a habit with my father to say grimly that\\nUncle Obad’s Christmas dinner was the most expensive he had ever\\neaten--it had cost him two thousand pounds. This was the only reference\\nto the unfortunate past that he permitted himself. On calm reflection\\nI think he was a little sorry for the caustic frankness of some of his\\nremarks; he was willing to forget them. Besides, as it happened, one of\\nmy uncle’s least forgivable offenses--the mentioning of our names to the\\nnewspaper men--resulted in an extraordinary stroke of luck.\\n\\nA week after our visit to Chelsea, my father received a letter. It was\\nfrom a firm of lawyers and stated that a friend, who had read of our\\nloss, was anxious to provide the money for my education; the only\\ncondition made was that he should be allowed to remain anonymous.\\n\\nAt first my father flatly refused to put himself under such an\\nobligation to an unknown person. “One would think that we were paupers,”\\n he said; “such an offer may be kindly meant, but it’s insulting.”\\n\\nHe was so sensitive on the subject that we none of us dared to argue the\\nmatter. We considered the affair as closed, and began to consider what\\nwalk of business I should enter. Then we discovered that my father had\\ngone off on the quiet and interviewed the lawyers; as a consequence,\\na second and more pressing letter arrived, stating that the anonymous\\nbenefactor would be gravely disappointed if we did not accept. He was\\nchildless and had often wished to do something for me. My father’s\\nmisfortune was his opportunity.\\n\\nOur curiosity was piqued. Who of our friends or acquaintance was\\nchildless? We ran over the names of all possible benefactors--a task not\\ndifficult, for we had few friends.\\n\\nThe name of my mother’s father, Sir Charles Evrard, was suggested. He\\nfitted the description exactly; the long estrangement which had resulted\\nfrom my father’s elopement supplied the motive for his desire to\\nsuppress his personality.\\n\\nOut of this guess Ruthita wove for me a romantic future, opening to my\\nastonished imagination a career more congenial than any I had dreamt in\\nmy boldest moments. Up to this time, save for whispered hints from my\\ngrandmother Cardover, no mention had been made of my mother’s family.\\nMy father’s plebeian pride had never recovered from the shock and\\nhumiliation of his early years. At first out of jealous purpose,\\nlatterly from force of habit and the delicacy which men feel after\\nre-marriage, he had allowed me to grow up in almost entire ignorance of\\nmy maternal traditions.\\n\\nNow that the subject had to be discussed he became obstinately silent to\\nthe point of sullenness. The Snow Lady came to the rescue. “Leave him to\\nme,” she said; “I know how to manage him, my dear.”\\n\\nShe laid it tactfully before him that he had no right to let his\\npersonal likes or dislikes prevent me from climbing back into my\\nmother’s rank in society. I was my grandfather’s nearest kin and, if our\\nsurmise proved correct, this might be Sir Charles’s first step towards\\na reconciliation--a step which might end in his making his will in my\\nfavor.\\n\\nGrandmother Cardover was communicated with and instructed to report on\\nthe lie of the country. She replied that folks said that old Sir Charles\\nwas wonderfully softened. She also informed us that Lord Halloway, the\\nnext of kin to myself, had been up to some more of his devilry and\\nwas in disgrace with his uncle. This time it was to do with a Ransby\\nbathing-machine man’s daughter. Lord Halloway was my second-cousin, the\\nEarl of Lovegrove’s son and heir. His Christian name was Denville; I\\ncame to know him less formally in later days as Denny Halloway.\\n\\nI was packed off to my grandmother, ostensibly for a week’s holiday at\\nRansby--in reality to put our hazard to the test.\\n\\nRansby to-day is a little sleepy seaside town. The trade has gone away\\nfrom it. Every summer thousands of holiday-makers from London invade it\\nwith foreign, feverish gaiety; when they are gone it relapses into its\\ncontented old-world quiet. In my boyhood, however, it was a place of\\nprovincial bustle and importance. The sailing vessels from the Baltic\\ncrowded its harbor, lying shoulder to shoulder against its quays,\\nunloading their cargoes of tallow and timber and hemp. Now all that\\nremains is the herring fishery and the manufacture of nets.\\n\\nGrandmother Cardover’s house stood near the harbor; from the street we\\ncould see the bare masts of the shipping lying at rest. In the front\\non the ground-floor was the shop, piled high with the necessaries of\\nsea-going travel. There were coils of rope in the doorway, and anchors\\nand sacks of ship’s biscuits; a little further in tarpaulin and oil-skin\\njackets hung from the ceiling, interspersed with smoked hams; and, at\\nthe back, stood rows of cheeses and upturned barrels on which ear-ringed\\nsailor-men would sit and chat.\\n\\nBehind the counter was a door, with windows draped with red curtains.\\nIt led into what was called the keeping-room, a cozy parlor in which we\\ntook our meals, while through the window in the door we could watch\\nthe customers enter. The keeping-room had its own peculiar smell,\\ncomfortable and homelike. I scarcely know how to describe it; it was a\\nmixture of ozone, coffee, and baking bread. Out of the keeping-room lay\\nthe kitchen, with its floor of red bricks and its burnished pots and\\npans hung in rows along the walls. It was my grandmother’s boast that\\nthe floor was so speckless that you could eat a meal off it. Across the\\ncourtyard at the back lay the bakehouse, with its great hollow ovens and\\ntroughs in which men with naked feet trod out the dough.\\n\\nGrandmother had never been out of Ransby save to visit us at Pope Lane,\\nand this rarely. Even then, after a fortnight she was glad to get back.\\nShe said that Ransby was better than London; you weren’t crowded\\nand knew everyone you met. The streets of London were filled with\\nstranger-windows and stranger-faces, whereas in Ransby every house was\\nfamiliar and had its story.\\n\\nShe carried, strung from a belt about her waist, all the keys of\\nher bins and cupboards. You knew when she was coming by the way they\\njangled. She was a widow, and perfectly happy. On Sundays she attended\\nthe Methodist Chapel in the High Street, with its grave black pulpit and\\nhigh-backed pews. On week-days she marshaled her sea-captains, handsome\\nbearded men, and entertained them at her table. In spite of younger\\nrivals, who tried to win their patronage from her by cuts in prices, she\\nheld their custom by her honest personality. I believe many of them made\\nher offers of marriage, for she was still comely to look at; she refused\\nthem as lovers and kept them as friends. She usually dressed in black,\\nwith a gold locket containing the hair of her husband, many years dead,\\nhung about her neck. Her hair was arranged in two rows of corkscrew\\ncurls, which reached down to her shoulders from under a prim white cap.\\nShe had a trick of making them waggle when she wished to be emphatic.\\nShe was a good deal of a gossip, was by instinct an antiquary, and had\\na lively sense of wit which was kept in check by a genuine piety--in\\nshort, she was a thoroughly wholesome, capable, loving woman. The type\\nto which she belonged is now quickly vanishing--that of the more than\\nmiddle-aged person who knows how to grow old usefully and graciously:\\na woman of the lower-middle class not chagrined by her station, who\\nacknowledged cheerfully that she had her superiors and, demanding\\nrespect from others, gave respect ungrudgingly where it was due. She was\\na shop-keeper proud of her shop-keeping.\\n\\nThat week at Ransby was a kind of tiptoe glory. My Grannie took me very\\nseriously; she had under her roof a boy who would surely be a baronet,\\nperhaps a lord, and maybe an earl. What had only been an expectation\\nwith us was for her a certainty. The floodgate of her reminiscence\\nwas opened wide; she swept me far out into the romantic past with her\\naccounts of my mother’s ancestry. The Evrards were no upstart nobility;\\nthey had their roots in history. She could tell me how they returned\\nfrom exile with King Charles, or how they sailed out with Raleigh to\\ndestroy the Armada. But I liked to hear best about my mother, how she\\nrode into Ransby under her scarlet plumes, on her great gray horse, with\\nher flower face; and how my father caught sight of her and loved her.\\n\\nI began to understand my father in a new way, entirely sympathetic.\\nHe was a man who had tasted the best of life at the first. There was\\nsomething epic about his sorrow.\\n\\nThese conversations usually took place in the keeping-room at night. The\\nshutters of the shop had been put up. The gas was unlighted. The flames\\nof the fire, dancing in the grate, split the darkness into shadows which\\ngroped across the walls. Everything was hushed and cozy. My Grannie,\\nseated opposite to me, on the other side of the fireplace, would bend\\nforward in her chair as she talked; when she came to exciting passages\\nher little gray curls would bob, or to passages of sentiment she would\\nremove her shiny spectacles to wipe her eyes. If she stopped at a loss\\nfor the next topic, all I had to say was, “And how did Sir Charles\\nEvrard look, Grannie, when he came to you that first morning after they\\nhad run away?”\\n\\n“He looked, as he has always looked, my dear, an aristocrat.”\\n\\n“But how did he treat you? Wasn’t he angry?”\\n\\n“Angry with a woman! Certainly not. He treated me like a courtly\\ngentleman--with respect. He dismounts and comes into my shop as\\nleisurely as though he had only stepped in to exchange the greetings\\nof the day. He raises his hat to me as he enters. ‘A fine day, Mrs.\\nCardover,’ he says.\\n\\n“‘A fine day, Sir Charles, but inclined to blow up squally,’ says I.\\n\\n“Then he turns his face away and inquires, ‘If it’s not troubling you,\\ncan I see your son this morning?’\\n\\n“‘He went to London early,’ says I.\\n\\n“He puts his hand to his throat quickly, as if he were choking. Then he\\nasks huskily, still not looking at me, ‘Did he go alone?’\\n\\n“‘That, Sir Charles, is more than I can say.’\\n\\n“‘Quite right. Quite right.’ And he speaks so quickly that he startles\\nme.\\n\\n“Then he turns round, trying to smile, and shows me a face all old and\\npale. ‘A very fine day for someone; but it’s true what you say, it’ll\\nblow up squally later.’\\n\\n“And with that he leaves me, raising his hat, and rides away.”\\n\\n“And you knew all the time?” I ask.\\n\\n“We both knew all the time,” she replies.\\n\\nDuring the daytime we went through the flat wind-swept country on\\nexcursions to Woadley Hall. Our hope was that we might meet Sir Charles,\\nand that he would recognize me. Unfortunately, on the afternoon of my\\narrival he had a hunting accident, and kept the house during all the\\nperiod of my stay. My nearest approach to seeing him was one evening,\\nwhen the winter dusk had gathered early; I hid in the shrubbery outside\\nthe library and saw his shadow fall across the blind. He seemed to stand\\nnear the window listening. We were not more than two yards separated. I\\nwonder, did some instinct, subtler than the five senses, let him know of\\nthe starved yearning that was calling to him out there in the dark?\\nHow those long watches in Woadley Park stirred up memories, and made my\\nmother live again!\\n\\nWhen the week had expired, I returned to Pope Lane. The offer was\\nre-debated and at last accepted. I went back to the Red House and there\\nlearnt the fickleness of popularity. My uncle’s downfall had caused me\\nto become a far less exalted person. My influence was gone; a period of\\npersecution threatened. The Bantam alone stood by me; even in his eyes I\\nwas a Samson shorn of his glory. The renewed, half-shy interest taken in\\nme by the Creature was a doubtful asset. Our friendship was a coalition\\nof two weaknesses, and resulted in nothing profitable in the way of\\nsocial strength. He did his best to make things up to me. He was almost\\nwomanly in his kindness. Now that Lady Zion was gone he felt a great\\nemptiness in life; he borrowed me that, in some measure, I might fill\\nher place. He told Sneard that he wished to coach me that I might sit\\nfor a scholarship at Oxford. Permission was granted, so we both got off\\nprep.\\n\\nEvening after evening I would spend at his cottage, the lamp lighted and\\nthe books spread out on the table. He decided that I was not much good\\nat natural science, and declared that I must specialize in history. He\\nwas a genius in his way, and had amazing stores of information. When he\\novercame his hesitating shyness, he showed himself a scholar of erudite\\nknowledge and intrepid imagination. He had a passion for antiquity that\\namounted to idolatry, and a faculty which was almost uncanny for making\\nthe dead world live again. While he spoke I would forget his shabbiness,\\nhis chalk-stained hands, uncouth gestures, and revolting untidiness. He\\nwas a magician who unlocked the doors of the storied past; he owned the\\nright-of-way through all men’s minds, from Homer to Herbert Spencer.\\nWhen he spoke of soldiers, his air was bullying and defiant. But it was\\nwhen he spoke of women that he spoke with his heart. Then, all unaware\\nof what he was doing, he pulled aside the curtains and let me gaze in\\nupon the empty rooms of his life. It was he who pointed out to me that,\\nwith rare exceptions, it is not the virtuous but only the beautiful\\nwomen that the world remembers.\\n\\nIt was odd to think what images of loveliness went to and fro behind\\nthat soiled mask of outward personality, in the hidden temples of\\nhis brain. The Creature was a man you had to love or dislike, to know\\naltogether or not to know at all. In that last year and a half at the\\nRed House, when he tapped me on the shoulder and led me away by the\\nrevelation of his curious secret charm, I got both to know and to love\\nhim.\\n\\nAnd yet there was always fear in my friendship. He was queer like his\\nsister before him. Her death seemed to have unbalanced his reason; it\\nwas a weakness that grew upon him. He seemed to have lost his power of\\ndistinguishing between the present and the imaginary or the past. Often\\nin the cottage he would forget that his sister was not still alive and,\\nrising from the table, would look beyond me as if he saw her, or would\\ngo out into the passage and call to her. Nothing in the cottage had been\\nchanged since her departure. Her belongings lay untouched, just where\\nshe had left them, as though her return was hourly expected.\\n\\nHe fell into the way of imitating her gestures, and humming snatches of\\nher crazy songs. He would tumble over the precipice into the abyss of\\ninsanity without warning, in the middle of being rational; and would\\nclamber back just as suddenly, apparently without knowledge of where he\\nhad gone. Of one of her songs he was extremely fond. I had often heard\\nLady Zion sing it as she rode between the hedges, and had been made\\naware of her approach long before I caught sight of her:--\\n\\n               “All the chimneys in our town\\n\\n               Wake from death when the cold comes down;\\n\\n               Through the summer against the sky\\n\\n               Tall, and silent, and stark they lie--\\n\\n               But every chimney in our town\\n\\n               Starts to breathe when the cold comes down.”\\n\\nSome safe-guarding astuteness prevented him from showing his weakness\\nat the Red House; and I was too fond of him to tell. To the rest of the\\nboys he was only the grubby, somewhat eccentric little “stinks” master.\\nNevertheless, sane or insane, it was through the Creature’s efforts\\nthat, after a year of coaching, I won a history scholarship at Lazarus\\nfor eighty pounds.\\n\\nStill, eighty pounds would not carry me to Oxford. It became a worrying\\nproblem to my family exactly what my grandfather, if he were my\\nbenefactor, had meant by “undertaking the expenses of my education.” His\\ngenerosity might be co-terminous with my school-days. A month after the\\nwinning of the scholarship the lawyers wrote, setting our minds at rest\\nand congratulating me on my success in the name of their client. This\\nletter was gratifying in more than a monetary sense--it was a sign that\\nthe anonymous friend was keeping a close watch on my doings.\\n\\nSince the interview at Chelsea there had been no intercourse between my\\nfather and Uncle Obad. I had once contrived to see my uncle by stealth,\\nbut the first question he had asked me was, did I come with my father’s\\nknowledge. When I could not give him that assurance, he had sorrowfully\\nrefused to have anything to do with me. At the time I shrank from\\nmentioning the matter to my father; so for a year and a half my uncle\\nand his doings had dropped completely out of my life.\\n\\nBut my treatment of him weighed on my conscience. My last term at school\\nhad ended. It was August, and in October I expected to go up to Oxford.\\nWith my scholarship and the money the lawyers sent me I should soon be\\na self-supporting person. Already I thought myself a man. I felt that on\\nthe whole my father’s quarrel with my uncle was reasonable, but I could\\nnot see why I should be made to share it. So one day as I got up from\\nbreakfast, I mentioned casually that I was going to run over to Charity\\nGrove.\\n\\nIt was just such another golden morning as the one of ten years earlier,\\nwhen I had driven for the first time across London behind Dollie. What\\na big important person the Spuffler had seemed to me then! How wonderful\\nthat he, a grown-up, should take so much trouble to be friendly to\\na little chap! Then my mind wandered back over all his repeated\\nkindness--all that he had stood for in the past as a harbor of refuge\\nfrom the stormy misunderstandings of childhood. He and the Creature,\\nboth failures and generally despised, were two of the best men that I\\nhad ever met. Whatever his faults, he still was splendid.\\n\\nI came to the Christian Boarding House, and passed up the driveway shut\\nin with heavy evergreens. Caroline, tousled of hair, all loose ends,\\ngirt about her middle with a sackcloth apron, was on her knees bricking\\nthe steps. She did not recognize me. The Mistress was out shopping, she\\nsaid, but the Master was in the paddock. “Ah, yes,” I thought, “feeding\\nthe fowls.”\\n\\nI passed through the decayed old rooms, with their heavy shabby\\nfurniture, so evidently picked up cheap at auctions; then I passed out\\nthrough the French windows into the cool garden, where sunshine dappled\\nthe lawn, struggling with difficulty through the crowded branches. At\\nthe gate into the paddock I halted. There he was with a can of water in\\nhis hand, fussing, in and out his coops and hutches, so extremely busy,\\nas though the future of the world depended on his efforts. I suppose\\nhe was still evolving that strain of perpetually laying hens, The\\nSpreckles, which was to bring him fame and fortune.\\n\\nI called to him, “Uncle Obad.”\\n\\nWhen he had recovered from his emotion, I soon found that the old fellow\\nhad long ago emerged from all personal sense of disgrace with his usual\\ncorklike irrepressibility. He chatted with me cheerily, calling me, “Old\\nchap,” just as though nothing painful had happened to separate us.\\nOn being ousted from Chelsea, he had immediately dropped back, with\\nsomething like a sigh of relief, into his former world of momentous\\ntrifles--philanthropy and fowls. “We lived at a terrible pace, old chap.\\nIt was wearing us out. We couldn’t have stood it.”\\n\\nHe spoke as if the abdication of his brief period of affluence had\\nbeen voluntary. I scented here one of his spuffling explanations to his\\nneighbors for his precipitate return to the boarding-house.\\n\\nOn inquiry I found that all his philanthropic societies had forgiven\\nand taken him back. After sulking a while and flirting with various\\npaid secretaries, they had agreed for economy’s sake to let bygones be\\nbygones. They had been unable to find any other person who would serve\\nthem as loyally without salary, and who at the same time was able\\nto offer up such beautiful extempore prayers. The list of their\\ncontributors had afforded Rapson his happiest hunting-ground. Procuring\\nmy uncle’s services for nothing was their only way of getting anything\\nback.\\n\\n“And what about Rapson?” I asked. “Do you still believe in him?”\\n\\nHe shook his head dolefully. “I begin to lose faith, Dante; I begin to\\ndoubt.”\\n\\n“But have you heard from him since he went away?”\\n\\n“Never a word.”\\n\\nHe hesitated and then he said, “There’s Kitty, you know. He didn’t do\\nthe straight thing by her. No, I’m afraid Rapson wasn’t a good man.”\\n\\nAt mention of Kitty I pricked up my ears; I had often wondered about\\nher. “What had Kitty to do with him?” I asked. “Were they engaged?”\\n\\n“No, unfortunately.”\\n\\n“In love?”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Married?”\\n\\n“I wish they had been. After he’d left her, she was awfully cut up. I\\ndid what I could for her. You remember that hundred pounds?”\\n\\n“My father--at Chelsea--the Christmas present?”\\n\\n“Yes. I couldn’t keep it. I gave it to her.”\\n\\n“You always have to be giving something,” I said.\\n\\nWe were sitting on an upturned barrow in the paddock when this\\nconversation took place. I thought how characteristic of Uncle Obad that\\nwas--to be helping others at a time when he himself was most in need of\\nhelp. But his kindness knew no seasons. Then I began, as a very young\\nman will, to think of Kitty, and, because of her frailty, to picture her\\nthrough a haze of romance.\\n\\n“Where’s Kitty now?” I asked.\\n\\n“She’s in a photographer’s at Oxford. She serves behind a counter. But,\\ncome, you’ve not told me yet what you think of my fowls.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI--STAR-DUST DAYS\\n\\nThe walls of the garden had fallen. Childhood was ended and with it all\\nthose absurd, aching fears lest I should never be a man and lest time\\nmight be a stationary, unescapable present, with no trap-doors giving\\naccess to the future. The experiment of life had begun in earnest, and\\nthe adventure.\\n\\nThat first October night of my residence at Oxford is forever memorable.\\nBefore leaving Pope Lane I had been led aside by my father. He had taken\\nit for granted that I was now capable of a man’s follies and had warned\\nme against them. Somehow his assumption that I had it in my choice to\\nbecome a Don Juan warmed my heart; it impressed me as a tribute to my\\nmanhood--a tacit acknowledgment that I was a free agent. Free at last!\\n\\nI did not understand one-tenth part of all that he hinted at. But his\\npresumption that I did understand seemed to me a form of compliment. To\\nask for an explanation was a heroism of which I was not capable. So I\\nleft home clad in the armor of ignorance to do battle with the world.\\n\\nRuthita wanted to accompany me to the station. I would not let her. She\\nwas weepy in private; I knew that in public she would be worse. I had\\ninherited my father’s dread of sentiment and his fear lest other people\\nshould construe it as weakness.\\n\\nAt Paddington I met the Bantam; we were entering the same college\\nand traveled up together. We chose our places in a “smoker” by way of\\nemphasizing to ourselves our emancipation. We tried to appear ordinary\\nand at ease; beneath our mask of carelessness we felt delightfully bold\\nand bad. In our carriage were three undergraduates, finished products\\nof indifferent haughtiness. Though no more than a year our seniors, they\\nloaded their pipes and puffed away without fear or furtiveness. They\\naffected to be unaware of us. They were infinitely bored in manner and\\naddressed the porters in a tone of lackadaisical, frigid tolerance. What\\nmasterfulness! And yet one term of Oxford would give us the right to\\nbe like that!--we, who so recently had been liable to be told that\\nchildren must be seen and not heard. The assurance of these youthful men\\nimperiled our courage.\\n\\nAs we neared Iffley, the domes and spires of the Mecca of dreamers swam\\nup. The sky was pearl- without a cloud. Strewn throughout its\\ngreat emptiness was the luminous dust of stars. All the tinsel ambitions\\nwhich had lately stirred me were forgotten as the home of lost causes\\nclaimed me. I grew large within myself as, in watching its advance\\nbehind the river above the tree-tops, I merged my personality in this\\nvision of architectural romance. Leaning against the horizon, stretching\\nup and up, out of the murk of dusk and the blood-red decay of foliage,\\nit symbolized for me all the yearning after perfection and the\\npassionate desire for freedom that had always lain hidden in my heart.\\nI wanted to be like that--the thing that gray pyramided stone seen at\\ntwilight can alone express--wise, unimpassioned, lovely, immutable.\\n\\nWe came to a standstill in the shabby station, which of all stations is\\nprobably the best beloved.\\n\\n“Thank the Lord, we’re here at last.”\\n\\nIn a hansom, with a sporting cabby for our driver, we rattled through\\nthe ancient lamp-lit town where the ghosts of the dead summer rustled\\nand reddened against the walls. Past the Castle we sped, through Carfax,\\ndown the High, past Oriel and Christ Church till we drew up with a jerk\\nat Lazarus. Whatever we had suffered in the train in the way of lowered\\nopinion of self was now made up to us; the servility of the College\\nporter and scouts was eloquent of respect. We were undoubtedly persons\\nof importance. If we wanted further proof of it, this awaited us in the\\npile of communications from Oxford tradesmen, notified beforehand of our\\ncoming, humbly soliciting our patronage.\\n\\nThe Bantam’s room and mine were next door to one another in Augustine’s\\nQuad; fires were burning in the grates to bid us welcome. The scout, who\\nacted as guide, seized the opportunity to sell us each a second-hand\\ntin bath, a coal-scuttle, and a kettle at very much more than their\\nfirst-hand prices. We felt no resentment. His deferential manner was\\nworth the extra.\\n\\nJust as we had commenced unpacking, the bell began to toll. We slipped\\non our gowns and followed the throng into a vaulted, dimly-lighted\\nhall, where we dined at long tables off ancient silver, and had beer set\\nbefore us. Surely we were men!\\n\\nThat night the Bantam and I sat far into the small, cold hours of the\\nmorning; there was no one to worry us to go to bed. When the Bantam had\\nleft, I lay awake in a state of bewildered ecstasy. I had become aware\\nin the last ten hours of my unchartered personality. I realized that\\nmy life was my own to command, to make or mar. As the bells above the\\nsleeping city rang out time’s progress, all the pageant of the lads of\\nother ages, who had come up to Oxford star-eyed, as I had come, passed\\nbefore me. When the withered leaves tapped against the walls, I could\\nfancy that it was their footfall. They had come with a chance equal to\\nmine; at the end of a few years they had departed. Some had succeeded\\nand some had failed. Of all that great army which now stretched\\nbivouacked throughout eternity, only the latest recruits were in sight.\\nThe scholar-monks, the soldier-saints, the ruffian-students of early\\ncenturies, the cavaliers, the philosophers, and the statesmen,\\ntogether with the roisterers of the rank and file, were all equally and\\ncompletely gone.\\n\\nIn the silence of my narrow room, with the flickering fire dying in the\\nhearth, there brooded over me the shadowy darkness of the ages. What\\nreligion does for some men, for me the gray poetry of this poignant\\ncity accomplished. I had become aware that from henceforth the ultimate\\nresponsibility for my actions must rest forever with myself. I was\\nstrangely unafraid of this knowledge.\\n\\nThey were dim dawn-days that followed, when the air was filled with\\nstar-dust--neither with suns, nor moons, nor stars, only with the\\nexcitement of their promise. My world was at twilight, blurred and\\nmysterious; only the huge design was clearly discernible--the cracks\\nand imperfections were concealed from me, shrouded in dusk. I lived in\\na land of ideals, drawing my rules of conduct from the realism of the\\nclassics--a realism which even to the Greeks and Romans was only an\\naspiration, never a practice. Existence had for me all the piquant\\nfascination which comes of half-knowledge--the charming allurement,\\nleaving room for speculation, which the glimpse of a girl’s face has at\\nnightfall. It was an age when all things seemed possible, because all\\nwere untested.\\n\\nGradually, out of the wilderness of strange faces, some became more\\nfamiliar than others; little groups of friends began to form. The\\ninstinctive principle on which my set came together was enthusiastic\\nrebellion against convention and eager curiosity concerning existence.\\nOne by one, without appointing any place of meeting, we would drift into\\nsome man’s room. This usually occurred about eight in the evening, after\\ndinner in hall. The lamp would be left unlighted; the couch would be\\ndrawn near the fire; then we would commence a conversation which was\\nhalf jesting and half confessional.\\n\\nUnder the cloak of laughing cynicism we hid a desperate purpose. We\\nwanted to know about life. We sought in each new face to discover if\\nit could tell us. We had nothing to guide us but the carefully prepared\\ndisclosures which had been vouchsafed us in our homes. We had risen at\\na bound into a man’s estate, and still retained a boy’s knowledge. We\\nrealized that life was bigger, bolder, more adventurous, more disastrous\\nthan we had reckoned. Why was it that some men failed, while others had\\nsuccess? What external pressures caused the difference in achievement\\nbetween Napoleon, for instance, and Charles Lamb? Who was responsible\\nfor our varying personalities? Where did our own responsibility begin,\\nand where did it end?\\n\\nThe problems we argued predated the Decalogue, yet to us they were\\neternally original and personal. We attacked them with youthful\\ninsolence. The authority of no social institution was safe from our\\nirreverence. We accepted nothing, neither religion, nor marriage; we had\\nto go back to the beginning and re-mint truth for ourselves. Our real\\nobject in coming together was that we might pool our scraps of actual\\nexperience, and out of these materials fashion our conjectures.\\n\\nThere was one topic of inexhaustible interest. It permeated all our\\ninquiry--_woman_. We knew so little about her; but we knew that she held\\nthe key opening the door to all romance. What gay cavaliers we could\\nbe in discussing her, and how sheepish in the presence of one concrete\\nspecimen of her sex--especially if she were beautiful, and not a\\nrelative!\\n\\nAll the adventures we had ever heard of seemed now within our grasp.\\nWoman was the great unknown to us. We knew next to nothing of the\\npenalties--only the romance.\\n\\nLittle by little the boldest among us, recognizing that talk led\\nnowhere, began to put matters to the test. The same shy restraint that\\nhad made me afraid of Fiesole when she had tempted me to kiss her, made\\nme an onlooker now. A saving common sense prompted me to await the proof\\nof events. I acted on instinct, not on principle. The difference between\\nmyself and some of my friends was a difference of temperament. Perhaps\\nit was a difference between daring and cowardice. There are times when\\nour weaknesses appear to be virtues, preserving us from shipwreck. I was\\ncapable of tempestuous thoughts; while they remained thoughts I could\\nclothe them with idealism and glamor. But I was incapable of impassioned\\nacts; their atmosphere would be beyond my control--the atmosphere\\nof inevitable vulgarity which results from contemporary reality. My\\nobservation of unrestraint taught me that unrestraint was ugly. In\\nshort, I had a pagan imagination at war with a puritan conscience.\\n\\nIn my day, there was no right or wrong in undergraduate Oxford--no moral\\nor immoral. Every conventional principle of conduct which we had learnt,\\nwe flung into the crucible of new experience to be melted down and, out\\nof the ordeal, minted afresh.\\n\\nWe divided ourselves into two classes: those who experimented and\\nthose who watched. There was only one sin in our calendar--not to be\\na gentleman. To be a gentleman, in our sense of the word, was to be a\\nsportsman and to have good manners.\\n\\nIn our private methods of thought we were uninterfered with by those in\\nauthority. The University’s methods of disciplining our actions were,\\nand still are, a survival of mediævalism. If an undergraduate was seen\\nspeaking to a lady, he had to be able to prove her pedigree or run the\\nrisk of being sent down. At nine o’clock Big Tom rang; ten minutes later\\nevery college-door was shut and a fine was imposed for knocking in or\\nout. In the streets the proctors and their bulldogs commenced to go the\\nrounds. Until twelve a man was safe in the streets, provided he appeared\\nto be innocently employed and wore his cap and gown. Knocking into\\ncollege after twelve was a grave offense.\\n\\nIf a man observed these rules or was crafty, he might investigate life\\nto his heart’s content. Public opinion was extremely lenient. Conduct\\nwas a purely personal matter as long as it did not inconvenience anybody\\nelse. If a man had the all-atoning social grace, and was careful not to\\nget caught in an incriminating act, though everybody knew about it from\\nhis own lips afterwards, he was not censured.\\n\\nMy cousin, Lord Halloway, had been a Lazarus man. Oxford still treasured\\nthe memory of his amorous exploits.\\n\\nHe had been a good deal of a dare-devil and was regarded as something of\\na hero; he inspired us with awe, for, despite his recklessness, he had\\nplayed the game gaily and escaped detection. The impression that this\\nkind of thing created was that indiscretions were only indiscreet when\\nthey were bungled. Punishment seemed the penalty for discovery--not for\\nthe sin itself. Naturally it was the foolish and less flagrant sinners\\nwho got caught. For instance, there was the Bantam.\\n\\nThe first term the Bantam watched and listened. There were occasions\\nwhen he was a little shocked. When Christmas came round, having no home\\nto go to, he kept on his rooms in college, and spent the vacation in\\nresidence. I returned to Pope Lane, and found that the womanliness of\\nRuthita and the Snow Lady had a sanitary effect. The wholesome sweetness\\nof their affection, after the hot-house discussions of a group of\\nboyish men, came like a breath of pure air. I fell back into the old\\ntrustfulness. I recognized that society had secret restraints and\\ndelicacies, a disclosure of the motives for which was not yet allowable;\\nat the proper season life would explain itself.\\n\\nWhen college re-assembled I noticed a change in the Bantam. He was\\nsoulful and sentimental--he took more pains with his dressing. He was\\ncontinually slipping off by himself; when he returned he volunteered no\\ninformation as to the purpose of his errand. When the eternal problem\\nof woman was discussed, he smiled in a wise and melancholy manner. If\\nhe contributed a remark, it was not a guess, but had the air of\\nauthoritative finality. One night I tackled him. “What have you been up\\nto, Bantam? You know too much.”\\n\\nHe twisted his pipe in his mouth pensively. “She’s the sweetest little\\ngirl in the world.”\\n\\nHe would not tell me her name. He had pledged her his word not to do\\nthat. There was a reason--she was working, and she belonged to too high\\na rank in society to work. She wished to remain obscure, until she could\\nre-instate herself. She was a Cinderella who would one day emerge from\\npoverty into splendor. The Bantam said his emotions were almost too\\nsacred to talk about. Nevertheless, he meandered on with his mystery\\nfrom midnight to three o’clock. She was a lady and terribly persecuted.\\nHe had come to her rescue just at the identical moment when a good\\ninfluence was most needed. All through the Christmas Vac he had\\nacted the big brother’s part, shielding her from temptation. She was\\nlovely--there lay the pity of it.\\n\\nI pointed out that there were ten thousand ways of flirting with girls,\\nand that this was the most dangerous. His white knighthood was\\naffronted by that word _flirting_. He became indignant and said I was no\\ngentleman.\\n\\nAs time went on, acquaintance after acquaintance would drop in to see\\nme, and would hint gravely at a deep and romantic passion which the\\nBantam had imparted to them alone. When I informed them that I also\\nwas in his confidence, they would repeat to me the same vague story of\\npersecuted loveliness, but always with embellishments. By and by, the\\nembellishments varied so irreconcilably that I began to suspect that\\nthey referred to more than one girl.\\n\\nMost of us were in love with love in those days; we were all quite\\ncertain that an incandescent purifying passion lay ahead of us. It might\\nknock at our door any hour--and then our particular problem would be\\nsolved. This hope was rarely mentioned. To one another we strove to give\\nthe impression of being cynical and careless. Yet always, beneath our\\npose of flippancy, we were seeking the face pre-destined to be for us\\nthe most beautiful in all the world. For myself, I was feverishly\\neager in its quest. I would scour the green-gray uplands of the Thames,\\ntelling myself that she might lie hidden in the cheerful quiet of some\\nthatched farm. Every new landscape became the possible setting for\\nmy individual romance. I lived each day in expectancy of her coming.\\nSometimes at nightfall I would pause outside a lighted shop-window,\\narrested by a girl’s profile, and would pretend to myself that I had\\nfound her. That was how Rossetti found Miss Siddall; perhaps that was\\nhow it would happen to myself. One thing was certain: whenever and\\nwherever I found her, whether in the guise of shop-girl, dairy-maid, or\\nlady, for me the golden age would commence. I stalked through life on\\nthe airy stilts of an æsthetic optimism.\\n\\nAh, but the Bantam, he was all for doing! If he could not find the love\\nhe wanted, he would seize the next best. Yet he would never admit that\\nhe was in love. He deceived himself into believing that he acted on the\\nmost altruistic motives. If others misunderstood him, it was because\\nthey were of grosser fiber. Other men, doing the things he did,\\nlaughingly acknowledged their rakishness; he, however, considered\\nhimself a self-appointed knight-errant to ladies in distress. He became\\ninvolved in endless entanglements. It was by appealing to his higher\\nnature with some pitiful story, that his transient attractions caught\\nhim.\\n\\nI never knew a man so unfortunate in his genius for discovering lonely\\nmaidens in need of his protection. He always meant to be noble and\\nvirtuous, but his temperament was not sufficiently frigid to carry him\\nsafely through such ticklish adventures. He never learnt when to leave\\noff; his fatal and theatric conception of chivalry continually led him\\non to situations more powerfully tempting. It would be easy to explain\\nhim by saying that he was a sentimental ass. But so were we all. The\\nBantam came to his ruin because he was lonely, because he had no social\\nmeans of meeting women who were his equals, and because he was\\ntoo kind-hearted; but mainly because he attributed to all women\\nindiscriminately a virtue which unfortunately they do not all possess.\\n\\nHe sinned accidentally and therefore carelessly--not wisely, but too\\nwell. A man like Lord Halloway sinned of set purpose and laid his plans\\nahead; so far as society’s opinion of him was concerned he came off\\ncomparatively scatheless. The worst that was ever said of him was that\\nhe was a gay dog. Women even seemed to like him for it. I suppose he\\nintrigued their fancy, and made them long to reform him. From this I\\nlearnt that the gaping sins of a gay dog are more easily forgiven than\\nthe peccadilloes of a sentimental donkey.\\n\\nIn the Easter Vacation of our first year at Oxford, the Bantam stayed at\\nPutney. In the same house was an actress, very beautiful and more sorely\\nused by the world than even the first girl. In the summer-time there\\nwas a widow at Torquay. In the beginning of our second year of residence\\nthere was a bar-maid at Henley. After that they followed in rapid\\nsuccession. Wherever he went he found some woman starving for his\\nsympathy. They were all ladies and phenomena of beauty, to judge from\\nhis accounts.\\n\\nWhen he came to make confession to me, it was a little difficult to\\nfollow which particular lady he was talking about. He never mentioned\\nthem by name, and seemed to try to give the impression that they were\\none composite person.\\n\\nOne evening I got him with his back to the wall. “Bantam, who is this\\nOxford girl--the first one you got to know about?”\\n\\nThen he admitted that she was a shop-girl. I knew what that meant: some\\nof the Oxford tradesmen engaged girls for the prettiness of their faces,\\nthat they might attract custom by flirting with the undergrads. Little\\nby little I narrowed him down in his general statements till I had\\nguessed the shop in which she worked.\\n\\n“Is she a good girl?” I asked.\\n\\nInstead of taking offense, he answered, “Dante, the thought of her\\ngoodness often makes me ashamed of myself.”\\n\\nIt was evident, though he would not admit it, that this affair at least\\nwas serious.\\n\\n“Then why does she stay there?”\\n\\n“She can’t help herself.”\\n\\n“Why can’t she help herself?”\\n\\n“She’s an orphan and has a living to earn. She’s afraid to get out of a\\nsituation.”\\n\\n“But what good are you doing her?”\\n\\n“Helping her to keep up her courage by letting her know that one man\\nrespects her.”\\n\\n“Don’t you think she may get to expect more than that?”\\n\\n“Certainly not. Why should she?”\\n\\n“Just because girls do,” I said. “Do you write her letters?”\\n\\n“Sometimes.”\\n\\n“What do you write about?”\\n\\nHe wouldn’t tell me that. Next day I went down to the shop to\\ninvestigate matters. Since the Bantam wouldn’t listen to sense, I\\nintended to hint to the girl the danger of what she was doing. Of course\\nshe could never marry him; but I was morally certain that that was what\\nshe was aiming at.\\n\\nThe shop was a stationer’s. I had chosen an hour in the afternoon\\nwhen it was likely to be empty, everyone being engaged in some form\\nof athletics. I entered and saw a daintily gowned woman with her back\\nturned towards me. She was all in white. Her waist was of the smallest.\\nShe had a mass of honey- hair. She swung about at sound of my\\nfootstep.\\n\\n“Why, Kitty, of all people in the world! I didn’t expect to find you\\nhere.”\\n\\n“As good as old times,” she said. “I’ve often seen you pass the window,\\nbut I thought you wouldn’t want to know me.”\\n\\n“And why not?”\\n\\n“Because of what happened.”\\n\\n“Rapson?”\\n\\nShe flushed and hung her head. I wondered if she meant what I thought\\nshe meant.\\n\\nI hated to see her sad; she looked so young and pretty. I began to ask\\nher what she was doing.\\n\\n“Doing! Minding shop, remembering, growing old, and earning my living.\\nIt’s just horrid to be here, Dante. I have to watch you ’Varsity men\\nhaving a good time--and once I belonged to your set. And they come in\\nand stare at me, and pay me silly compliments--and I have to smile and\\npretend I like it. That’s what I’m paid for. They don’t know how I hate\\nthem. When they have their sweethearts and sisters up, they walk past me\\nas though they never knew me.”\\n\\n“But are they all like that?”\\n\\nShe smiled, and I knew she loved him. When she spoke her voice trembled.\\n“There’s one of them is different.”\\n\\n“Kitty, he’s the one I came to talk about.”\\n\\nWith instinctive foreknowledge of the purpose of my errand, her face\\nbecame tragic. “His father’s in India,” I explained. “From what I hear\\nof him he’s very proud. If the Bantam made a marriage that could in any\\nway be regarded as imprudent, he’d cut him off. He’d be ruined. You know\\nhow it would be; the world would turn its back on him.”\\n\\n“What do we care about the world?” she said. “The world’s a coward.”\\n\\nIt was wonderful how coldly practical I could become in dealing with\\nanother man’s heart affairs--I, who spent my time dreaming of the most\\nextraordinarily unconventional marriages.\\n\\n“The world may be a coward, Kitty, but you have to live in it. Besides,\\nare you sure that the Bantam really cares for you? Have you told him\\neverything?”\\n\\nShe stared into my eyes across the counter with frightened fascination.\\nI knew that I was acting like a brute and I despised myself. I had\\nhardly meant to ask her the last question--it had slipped out. While we\\ngazed at one another there drifted through my memory all the scenes of\\nthat day at Richmond--the gaiety of it, and the hunger with which she\\nhad clutched me to her as we punted back in the dark. I understood\\nwhat this little bit of love must mean to her after her experience of\\ndisillusion.\\n\\n“No, I have not told him. I daren’t. I’m afraid to lose him. Oh, Dante,\\ndon’t tell him; it’s my one last chance to be good.”\\n\\n“But you’ve got to tell him, Kitty. If his love’s worth anything, he’ll\\nforgive you. He’d be sure to find out after marriage.”\\n\\n“I don’t care about marriage,” she whispered desperately.\\n\\n“Even then, you ought to tell him.”\\n\\nA customer came into the shop. We tumbled from our height of emotion. It\\nwas another example of how reality makes all things prosaic. She had\\nto compose herself, and go and serve him. He had come to admire her\\nand showed a tendency to dawdle. His purchase was the excuse for his\\npresence. I had an opportunity to watch her--how charmingly fresh\\nshe looked and how girlish. And yet she was three years older than\\nmyself--that seemed incredible. At last the customer went.\\n\\n“Kitty, I feel I’ve been a horrid beast to you--it’s so often like that\\nwhen one speaks the truth. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I want to see you\\nhappy. I’ll not interfere. You must do what you feel to be right about\\nit.” And with that I left her.\\n\\nThe Bantam was rowing in the college crew that summer. What with\\ntraining, going to bed early, and keeping up with his work, I saw little\\nof him. The night before the races he came into my room. He looked\\nbrilliantly healthy--lean and tanned.\\n\\n“Are you alone?”\\n\\n“You can see I am. What’s the trouble?”\\n\\nHe sank into a chair and grinned at me. “It’s all up. I’ve been an awful\\nass.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“I wrote two letters; one to the widow at Torquay and the other to the\\nactress. They were nice friendly letters, but far too personal. I put\\n’em in the wrong envelopes.”\\n\\n“And they’ve sent them back with bitter complaints against your\\ninfidelity. Poor old Bantam!”\\n\\n“They haven’t. They’re keeping them as proof. They’ve both struck out\\nthe same line of action and talk about a breach of promise suit. They’re\\nboth coming to see me to-morrow, and they’re sure to meet. There’ll be a\\ngay old row, and I shall get kicked out of Lazarus.”\\n\\nI whistled.\\n\\n“You may well whistle,” he said, ridiculously puckering his mouth; “it’s\\na serious affair. Here have I been trying to be decent to two women, and\\nthey’re going to try to make me out a kind of letter-writing Bluebeard.\\nI know quite well I’ve written silly things to them that could be\\nconstrued in a horribly damaging manner. I only meant to be cheery,\\nyou know, but I see now that there’ve been times when I’ve crossed the\\nboundary of mere friendship. They can both make a case against me I\\nsuspect and so can all the other girls. Once the thing leaks into the\\npapers, they’ll all swoop down like a lot of vultures to see what they\\ncan get.”\\n\\n“What are you going to do about it?”\\n\\n“I can run away to-night without leaving any address. That would leave\\nthe crew in the lurch; we’d get bumped every night on the river--so I\\ncan’t do that. I can stop and face it out--let my pater in for all kinds\\nof expense in the way of damages, and get sent down. Or I can marry one\\nof ’em, and so shut all the others’ mouths. It isn’t money they’re\\nwanting--it’s me as a husband. Isn’t it a gay old world?”\\n\\nHe pushed his hands deep into his trouser-pockets and thrust out\\nhis legs. He didn’t seem adequately desperate--in fact he gave the\\nimpression of being glad this thing had happened. I was puzzling over\\nwhat I ought to say to him, when it occurred to me that I hadn’t offered\\nany expression of sympathy; I told him I was awfully sorry.\\n\\n“Needn’t be. You see, there’s only one girl I greatly care about,\\nand she’s just all the world. She had a mishap some years back with\\na cad--she only told me a month ago, and because of it she refused to\\nmarry me. She’s got it into her head that I’m too good for her. Well,\\nnow I can prove to her that it’s the other way about.”\\n\\nThe Bantam ruffled his hair. He spoke with genuine feeling; this was\\nquite different from any of his former confessions. He moistened his\\nlips nervously, and turned away his eyes from me. “There are some\\ngirls,” he said, “who never need to be forgiven. Whatever they’ve done\\nand whatever they’re doing, doesn’t matter. They seem always too pure\\nfor us men.”\\n\\nI leant forward and took his hand. I felt proud of him. “I’ll stand by\\nyou, old chap. How can I help?”\\n\\n“By being awfully decent to these two women to-morrow. Take ’em out on\\nthe river and keep ’em quiet. Drug ’em with flattery. They’re both\\nof them immensely good-looking. P’raps if you treat ’em well, they’ll\\nbe ashamed to make a row. Then, when Eights’ Week is over and the crew\\ndoesn’t want me any longer, I’ll slip up to London, and establish a\\nresidence, and get married.”\\n\\nAs he was going out of the room I called him back. “What’s the name of\\nthe girl you’re going to marry?”\\n\\n“Kitty,” he whispered below his breath, as though it were a word too\\nsacred to mention.\\n\\nThe widow from Torquay arrived next morning; so did the actress from\\nPutney. I let each one suppose that the other was my near relative, and\\nnever left them for a moment together, lest they should discover their\\nerror. I gave them separately to understand that their troubles would\\nbe satisfactorily settled. I made much of the rigors of training, which\\ncompelled the Bantam to absent himself. They didn’t meet him until after\\nthey had seen him racing, by which time he had become a kind of hero to\\nthem. I saw them safely off at the station by different trains--so the\\ncrash was averted. When Eights’ Week was ended the Bantam vanished,\\nwithout explanation to the college. A month later I attended his\\nwedding.\\n\\nKitty had asked permission to invite one guest--she wouldn’t tell us\\nhis name. When we three had assembled in the little Church of Old St.\\nMary’s, Stoke Newington, who should come fussing up the aisle but\\nmy uncle, the Spuffler. He wore a frayed frock-coat; the end of his\\nhandkerchief was hanging out of his tail-pocket, as usual.\\n\\nAll through the service he gave himself such important airs that the\\nclergyman took it for granted that the bride was his daughter.\\n\\nWe jumped into a couple of hansoms and drove down to Verrey’s to lunch.\\nThe Bantam said he knew he couldn’t afford it, but he was determined to\\nhave one good meal before he busted. We had a private room set apart\\nfor us. The Spuffler tasted the best champagne he had drunk since his\\nfiasco. It made him reflective. He kept on telling us that life was\\na switchback--an affair of ups and downs. The Bantam cut him short by\\nproposing a toast to all the ladies he hadn’t married. And I sat and\\nstared at Kitty, with her cornflower eyes and sky-blue dress, and\\nwondered where my eyes had been that I hadn’t married her myself.\\n\\nWe went to the Parks and took a boat on the Serpentine. It was there\\nthat the Bantam let his bomb burst: he was sailing on the _Celtic_,\\nvia New York, for Canada. He felt sure his father would disown him for\\nhaving spoilt his Oxford opportunities, so he was going to start life\\nafresh in a land where no one would remember.\\n\\nIn the autumn, when I returned to Lazarus, I had an opportunity to judge\\nhow the world treats breakers of convention. No one had a good word\\nto say for the Bantam. Everybody was eager to disclaim him as his\\nfriend--he had married a shop-girl. Yet Halloway, who sinned cavalierly\\nwithout twinge of conscience or attempt at reparation, was spoken\\nof, even by persons who had never known him, with a kind of tolerant,\\nadmiring affection. So much for what this taught me of social morality.\\nPlaying safe, and not ethical right or wrong, was the standard of\\nconventional righteousness.\\n\\nStar-dust days were drawing to an end. The grim, inevitable facts of\\nlife were looming larger and nearer. Romance was slowly giving way\\nbefore reality. It was the last year at Oxford for most of the men in\\nmy set. Conversations began to take a practical turn, as to how a living\\nmight be earned. For myself, I listened with a languid interest. These\\ndiscussions did not concern my future. I expected that my grandfather\\nwould continue my allowance. I should not be forced to sell myself by\\ndoing uncongenial, remunerative kinds of work. I should have time to\\nmature. I wanted to make a study of the Renaissance. About twenty years\\nhence I should publish a book; then I should be famous. Meanwhile I\\nshould collect my facts, and probably enter Parliament as member for\\nRansby.\\n\\nIt was wonderful how bravely confident we were. We gazed into the\\nfuture without fear or tremor. We all knew that we were sure of success.\\nAlready we were picking out the winners--the naturally great men, who\\nwould arrive at the top of the tree with the first effort. It was\\na belief among us that genius was nothing more than concentrated\\nwill-power. Then something happened which startled me into a novel\\ndisplay of energy.\\n\\nEver since leaving the Red House, the Creature had written me once a\\nweek, usually on a Sunday, with clockwork regularity. One Monday I went\\nto the porter’s lodge for my mail and missed his letter. The following\\nmorning, glancing down the paper, my eye was attracted by a headline\\nwhich read, TRAGIC DEATH OF A SCHOOLMASTER. The news-item announced the\\ndeath of Mr. Murdoch, science master of the Red House. It appeared that\\nthe boys had gone down to the laboratory to attend the experimental\\nchemistry class. On opening the door they had been driven back by a\\npowerful smell of gas, but not before they had caught a glimpse of Mr.\\nMurdoch fallen in a heap upon the floor. When the room was entered it\\nwas quite evident that the death was not accidental. Every burner in the\\nroom was full on, and the ventilators were stopped with rags.\\n\\nSome days later I received a legal letter informing me that the Creature\\nhad left a will in my favor. His total estate amounted to three hundred\\npounds. I was requested to call at the lawyer’s office. I got leave of\\nabsence from my college and went to London. There I learnt that at the\\ntime that the will had been made, a little over five years ago, the\\nvalue of the estate had been a thousand pounds. Of this I had already\\nreceived over seven hundred, remitted to me by his lawyers from time to\\ntime according to his instructions. He had originally saved the money\\nin order that he might provide for his sister in the event of his dying\\nfirst. On her death, he had executed the present will, making me his\\nheir.\\n\\nSo Sir Charles Evrard was not the author of my prosperity! The\\ndisappointment of the discovery robbed me for an instant of all sense\\nof gratitude. I felt almost angry with the Creature for having been the\\ninnocent cause of all this building of air-castles. This was the second\\ntime that fortune had led me on to expect, only to trick me when the\\nfuture seemed secure. The uncertainty of everything unnerved me. Life\\nseemed to pucker its brows and stare down at me with a frown. All\\nthe money that had been spent on my education had taught me nothing\\nimmediately useful--and now I had a living to earn.\\n\\nLuckily, just about this time, it was suggested to me that, after I had\\ntaken my Finals, I should enter for some of the history fellowships in\\nthe autumn. It was expected that I would gain an easy First; if I did\\nthat, I had a fair chance of winning a fellowship at my own college.\\n\\nNow that my fool’s paradise had melted into nothingness, I felt the\\nspur of necessity, and commenced to work strenuously. Gradually a higher\\nmotive than the mere hope of reward began to actuate my energy. I wanted\\nto be what the Creature had hoped for me. Now that he was gone, he\\nbecame very near to me. He was always haunting my memory. He had robbed\\nhimself that he might give me my chance. I felt humbled that I should\\nhave spent his money with so free a hand, while he had been living in\\ncomparative poverty. I could picture just how he looked that morning\\nwhen the boys burst into the laboratory. His hands were stained with\\nchalk. His uncombed hair fell back from his wrinkled forehead. He\\nwas wearing the same old clothes--the tweed jacket and gray flannel\\ntrousers--that I knew so well. Probably he looked both tired and dirty,\\nand a little disreputable.\\n\\nI reproached myself for the shortness of my letters to him. I saw now,\\nin the light of after events, how I might have been a strength to him.\\nHe had given me everything; I had given him nothing. His fineness of\\nfeeling had led him to prevent my gratitude. Never by the slightest hint\\nhad he left me room to guess that I was beholden to him. And now he was\\nbeyond reach of thanks.\\n\\nI recalled how I had teased him as a youngster, and had courted\\npopularity at his expense. When I was most angry against myself, I would\\ndrift back into the class-room where the boys were baiting him, and\\nwould hear him making his peace-offering, “Penthil, Cardover? Penthil,\\nBuzzard? Want a penthil?” And then, in spite of indignation, I had to\\nlaugh.\\n\\nWhen Finals came on I won my First and in the autumn gained a history\\nfellowship at Lazarus. It was worth two hundred pounds a year. It\\nallowed me ample time to travel and was tenable for seven years, on the\\ncondition that I did not marry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK III--THE GARDEN WITHOUT WALLS\\n\\n\\n_And behind them a flame burneth: and the land is as the garden of Eden\\nbefore them, and behind them a desolate wilderness._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I--I MEET HER\\n\\n\\nIt was June and wind was in the tree-tops. All the world was rustling\\nand birds were calling.\\n\\nFor the past seven months, since the winning of my fellowship, I had\\nbeen over-working and making myself brain-sick with thought. I was\\ntwenty-three, and had arrived at “the broken-toy age” when a young man,\\nhaving pulled this plaything of a universe to pieces, begins to doubt\\nhis own omniscience--his capacity to put it together. The more I sought\\nhelp from philosophies, the more I came to see that they were all\\nimperfect. No one had yet evolved a theory which had not at some point\\nto be bridged by faith--that beautiful optimism which is nothing less\\nthan the hearsay of the heart. I was all for logic these days.\\n\\nSo, when I heard the June wind laughing in the trees, I tossed my books\\naside. I left my doubts all disorderly upon the shelves to grow dusty,\\nand ran away. I would seek for the garden without walls. Having failed\\nto find it in libraries, I would search for it through the open country.\\nI had only two certainties to guide me--that I was young, and that the\\nworld was growing lovelier every day.\\n\\nI came down to quaint little Ransby, perched high and red above the old\\nsea-wall. Life was taken so much for granted there. No one inquired into\\nits why or wherefore. Everything that happened was accepted with a quiet\\nstoicism, as “sent from God.” When the waves rumbled on the shore, they\\nsaid the sea was talking to itself. When a crew sailed out and never\\nreturned, they said “God took them.” When times were bad, they looked\\nback and remembered how times were worse before. No one ever really\\ndied there, for in the small interests of a quiet community nothing was\\nforgotten--all the characteristic differences and shades of personality\\nwere treasured in memory, and so the dead lived on. Life for them was\\nan affair of compensations. “If there weren’t no partin’s, there’d be no\\nmeetin’s,” my grandmother used to say. And death was explained after the\\nsame simple fashion. Every pious Ransbyite believed that heaven would be\\nanother Ransby, with no more storms and an empty churchyard.\\n\\nI traveled down from London by an afternoon train. Shortly after six we\\nstruck the Broads, or inland waterways, which now narrow into rivers,\\nnow widen into lakes, flowing sluggishly through fat marshes to the sea.\\nOn the left hand as we flashed by, one caught glimpses of the spread\\narms of windmills slowly turning, pumping meadows dry, or jutting\\nabove gray sedges the ochre- sails of wherries plodding like\\ncart-horses from Ransby up to Norwich. Startled by the clamor of our\\npassage, a lonely heron would spring up and float indignantly away\\ninto the distant quiet. Now we would come to a field of wheat faintly\\nyellowing in the summer sunshine. Between green-gold stalks would flash\\nthe scarlet of the Suffolk poppy. Across the desecrated silence we\\nhurled the grime and commotion of cities, leaving an ugly blur of\\ngradually thinning smoke behind.\\n\\nThe evening glow was beginning. Picked out in gold, windows of thatched\\ncottages and steeples of sleeping hamlets burnt for an instant splendid\\nin the landscape. A child, warned of our approach, clambered on a\\nstile, and waved; laborers, plodding homeward with scythes across their\\nshoulders, halted to watch us go by. We burst as a disturbing element\\ninto the midst of these rustic lives; in our sullen hurry, they had\\nhardly noticed us before we had vanished.\\n\\nWith the country fragrance of newly-mown hay there began to mingle the\\ntar and salt of a seaport. We swayed across the tresseled bridge, where\\nthe Broads met the harbor. Ozone, smell of fish and sea-weed assailed\\nour nostrils. Houses grew up about us. Blunt red chimneys, like\\nmisshapen thumbs, jabbed the blue of the horizon; above them tall masts\\nof ships speared the sky. With rush and roar we invaded the ancient\\ntown, defiling its Dutch appearance of neatness, and affronting with\\nour gadabout swagger its peaceful sense of home-abiding. We came to a\\nstandstill in the station; all was clatter and excitement.\\n\\nThe visitors’ season was just commencing. The platform was crowded\\nwith Londoners greeting one another. Drawn up on the other side of the\\nplatform, parallel with the train, was a line of cabbies, most of whom\\nwere standing up in their seats, shouting and gesticulating. They had a\\ntouch of the sea about them--a weatherbeaten look of jolliness.\\n\\nAs I got out, my eye was attracted to a little girl who was climbing\\ndown from a neighboring compartment. She was unlike any English\\nchild--she lacked the sturdy robustness. My attention was caught by the\\ndainty faeriness of her appearance. She wore a foamy white muslin dress,\\ncut very short, with spreading flounces of lace about it. It was caught\\nup here and there with pink baby-bows of ribbon. Her delicate arms were\\nbare from the elbow. She was small-boned and slender. Her skirt scarcely\\nreached to her knees, so that nearly half her tiny height seemed to\\nconsist of legs. She had the slightness and moved with the grace of\\na child-dancer escaped from a ballet. But what completed her baby\\nperfection was the profusion of flaxen curls, which streamed down from\\nher shoulders to her waist. She saw me looking at her and laughed up\\nwith roguish frankness.\\n\\nHaving secured my luggage, I was pushing my way out of the station\\nthrough the long line of visitors and porters, when I saw the child\\nstanding bewildered by herself. In the crowd she had become separated\\nfrom whoever was taking care of her. I spoke to her, but she was crying\\ntoo bitterly to answer. Setting down my bags, I tried to comfort her,\\nsaying that I would stay with her till she was found. Suddenly her face\\nlit up and she darted from my side. I had a hurried vision of a lady\\npushing her way towards her. While she was stooping to take the little\\ngirl in her arms, I made off as quickly as I was able. Like my father, I\\ndetested a scene, and had a morbid horror of being thanked.\\n\\nHow good it was to smell the salt of the sea again. I passed up the\\nharbor where the fishing-fleet lay moored against the quay-side, and\\nsailormen, with hands deep in trouser-flaps, leant against whatever came\\nhandiest, pulling meditatively at short clay pipes. The business of the\\nday was over. Folk were tenacious of their leisure in Ransby; they had a\\nknack, peculiarly their own, of filling the evening with an undercurrent\\nsense of gaiety. Though townsmen, they were villagers at heart. When\\nwork was done, they polished themselves up and sat outside their houses\\nor came into the streets to exchange the news of the day. I turned from\\nthe harbor and passed down the snug quiet street in which stood the\\nhouse with CARDOVER painted above the doorway.\\n\\nAs I approached, the bake-house boy was putting the last shutter into\\nplace against the window. I entered the darkened shop on tiptoe, picking\\nmy way through anchors, sacks of ships’ biscuit, and coils of rope, till\\nI could peer through the glass-panel of the door into the keeping-room.\\nI loved to surprise the little old lady with the gray corkscrew curls\\nand rosy cheeks, so that for once she might appear undignified. But, as\\nI peered through, I met her eyes.\\n\\n“Why, Dante, my boy,” she cried, reaching up to put her arms round me,\\n“how you have grown!”\\n\\nI was always a boy to her; she would never let herself think that I had\\nceased to grow, for then I should have ceased to be a child.\\n\\nWe sat down to a typically Ransby meal, which they call high-tea. There\\nwere Ransby shrimps and Ransby bloaters on the table; everything was of\\nlocal flavor, and most of it was home-made. “You can’t get things like\\nthem in Lun’non,” Grandmother Cardover said, falling back into her\\nSuffolk dialect.\\n\\nThat night we talked of Sir Charles Evrard. Rumor proclaimed that Lord\\nHalloway had finally ruined his chances in that direction by his latest\\nescapade. It concerned a pretty housemaid at Woadley Hall, and the\\naffair had actually been carried on under Sir Charles’s very nose, as\\none might say. The girl was the daughter of a gamekeeper on the estate\\nand----! Well there, my Grannie might as well tell me everything!--there\\nwas going to be a baby. All that was known for certain was that Mr.\\nThomas, the gamekeeper--a ’ighly respectable man, my dear--had gone up\\nto the Hall with a whip in his hand and had asked to see Master Denny.\\nThe old Squire, hearing him at the door, had gone out to give him some\\ninstructions about the pheasantry. Mr. Thomas had given him a piece of\\nhis mind. And Sir Charles, having more than he could conveniently do\\nwith, had made a present to Denny Halloway of a bit of his mind. After\\nwhich Master Denny had left hurriedly for parts unknown. It was said\\nthat he had returned to Oxford, to read for Holy Orders as a sort of\\natonement. It was my grandmother’s opinion that the marriage-service\\nwasn’t much in his line.\\n\\nSo we rambled on, and the underlying hint of it all was that I had come\\nto Ransby in the nick of time to make hay while the sun was shining.\\n\\n“Grannie, you’ll never get me worked up over that again,” I told her.\\n\\n“Well but, if his Lordship don’t inherit, who’s goin’ to?” she\\npersisted. “I tell you, Dante, he’s got to make you his heir--he can’t\\nhelp it. The whole town’s talking about it. Sir Evrard’s bailiff hisself\\nwas in here to-day and I says to him, ‘Mr. Mobbs, who’s going to be\\nmaster now at Woadley Hall when the dear old Squire dies?’ And he\\nanswers me respectful-like, ‘It don’t do to be previous about such\\nmatters, Mrs. Cardover; but if you and me was to speak out our minds,\\nI daresay we should guess the same.’ ‘Is Sir Charles as wild with Lord\\nHalloway as folks do say?’ I asks him. Like a prudent man he wouldn’t\\ncommit hisself to words; but he throws up his hands and rolls his eyes.\\nNow what d’you think of that? If you knew Mobbs as I know him, you’d see\\nit was a sign which way the wind is blowing.”\\n\\nI was trying to think otherwise. I had banished this expectation from my\\nmind and wasn’t anxious to court another disappointment.\\n\\n“If it happens that way, it will happen that way,” said I.\\n\\nBut my grandmother wasn’t in favor of such indifferent fatalism. She\\nloved to picture me in possession of Woadley. She commenced to describe\\nto me all its farmlands and broad acres. She spoke so much as if they\\nwere already mine that at last I began to dream again. So we rambled\\non until at five minutes to midnight the grandfather clock cleared its\\nthroat, getting ready to strike.\\n\\n“Lawks-a-daisy me,” she exclaimed, “there’s that clock crocking for\\ntwelve! How you do get your poor old Grannie on talking!”\\n\\nWe lit our candles and climbed the narrow stairs to bed. Outside my\\nbedroom-door she halted. I wondered what else she had to tell me.\\nHolding her candle high, so that its light fell down upon her laughing\\nface, she made me a mocking courtesy, saying, “Good-night, Sir Dante\\nCardover.”\\n\\nNext morning I was up early. As I dressed I could smell the bread being\\ncarried steaming out of the bakehouse. Looking out of my window into the\\nred-brick courtyard I could see men’s figures, white with flour-dust,\\ngoing to and fro. The morning was clear and sparkling, as though washed\\nclean by rain. The sun was dazzling and the wind was blowing. From the\\nharbor came the creaking of sails being hoisted, and the cheery bustle\\nof vessels getting under way. Of all places this was home. My spirits\\nrose. I laughed, remembering the cobwebs of theories which had tangled\\nup my brain. Nothing seemed to matter here, save the wholesome fact of\\nbeing alive.\\n\\nAfter breakfast I stepped out into the street and wandered up toward the\\nharbor. The townsmen knew me and greeted me as I went by. I caught them\\nlooking after me with a new curiosity in their gaze. I began to\\nwonder whether I had made some absurd mistake in my dressing. I grew\\nuncomfortable and had an insane desire to see what kind of a spectacle\\nmy back presented. I tried to use shop-windows as mirrors, twisting\\nmy neck to catch glimpses of myself. Then there occurred to me what my\\ngrandmother had said to me on the previous night. So it _was_ true, and\\nall the town was talking about me!\\n\\nAs I approached the chemist shop at the top of the road, Fenwick, the\\nchemist, was sunning himself in the doorway.\\n\\n“Why, Mr. Cardover!” he exclaimed, stepping out on to the pavement\\nand seizing my hand with unaccustomed effusiveness. Then, lowering his\\nvoice, “Suppose you’ve heard about Lord Halloway?”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“It’s lucky to be you,” he added knowingly. “But, there, I always did\\ntell your Grannie that luck would turn your way.”\\n\\nI passed on through the sunshine in a wild elation. What if it were true\\nthis time? I asked myself. What if it were really true?\\n\\nRansby is built like a bent arm, jutting out into the sea, following the\\nline of the coast. At the extreme point of the elbow, where I was now\\nstanding, is the wooden pier, on which the visitors parade. Running\\nfrom the elbow to the shoulder is the sheltered south beach and the\\nesplanade, given up to visitors and boarding-houses. These terminate in\\nthe distance in a steep headland, on which stands the little village\\nof Pakewold. On the other side of the pier is the harbor, entering\\nor departing out of which fishing vessels and merchantmen may be seen\\nalmost any hour of the day. From the elbow to the finger tips, running\\nnorthward, is the bleak north beach, gnawed at by the sea and bullied\\nby every wind that blows. Here it is that most of the wrecks take place.\\nThe older portion of the town, climbing northward from the harbor,\\noverhangs it, scarred and weather-beaten. Where the town ends, seven\\nmiles of crumbling gorse-grown cliff continue the barricade.\\n\\nSeparating the town from the north beach, stretch the denes--a broad\\nstrip of grassy sand, on which fishing-nets are dried. Parallel with\\nthe denes is the gray sea-wall; and beyond the wall a shingle beach,\\nlow-lying and defended at intervals by breakwaters. Here the waves are\\ncontinually attacking: on the calmest day there is anger in their moan.\\nFrom far away one can hear the scream of pebbles dragged down as the\\nwaves recede, the long sigh which follows the weariness of defeat, and\\nthe loud thunder as the water hurls itself in a renewed attack along the\\ncoast. On the denes stands a lighthouse, warning vessels not to come too\\nclose; for, when the east wind lashes itself into a fury, the sea leaps\\nthe wall and pours across the denes to the foot of the town, like an\\ninvading host. A vessel caught in the tide-race at such a time, is flung\\nfar inland and left there stranded when the waves have gone back to\\ntheir place. Facing the denes, lying several miles out in the German\\nOcean, are a line of sand-banks; between them and the shore is a\\nchannel, known as the Ransby Roads, which affords safe anchorage to\\nvessels. Beyond the Roads and out of sight, lies the coast of Holland.\\n\\nI turned my steps to the northward, passing through the harbor where\\ngroups of ear-ringed fisher-folk were unloading smacks, encouraging one\\nanother with hoarse, barbaric cries. I stopped now and then to listen to\\nthe musical sing-song conversation of East Anglia, so neighborly and so\\nkindly. Here and there mounds of silver herring gleamed in the morning\\nsunshine. The constant sound of ropes tip-tapping as the breeze stirred\\nthem, sails flapping and water washing against wooden piles, filled the\\nair with the energy and adventure of sturdy life.\\n\\nThe exultation of living whipped the wildness in my veins. As I left\\nthe harbor, striking out across the denes, I caught the sound of\\nbreakers--the long, low rumble of revolt. Girls were at work, their hair\\ntumbled, their skirts blown about, catching up nets spread out on\\nthe grass beneath their feet and mending the holes. Some of them were\\nsinging, some of them were laughing, some of them were silent, dreaming,\\nperhaps, of sailor-lovers who were far away.\\n\\nAs I advanced, I left all human sounds behind. The red town, piled high\\non the cliff, grew dwarfed in the distance. I entered into a world of\\nnature and loneliness. Larks sprang from under my feet and rose into the\\nair caroling. Overhead the besom of the wind was busy, sweeping the\\nsky. From cliffs came the shy, old-fashioned fragrance of wall-flowers\\nnestling in crannies. Yellow furze ran like a flame through the bracken.\\nFar out from shore waves leapt and flashed, clapping their hands in\\nthe maddening sunshine. My cheeks were damp and my lips were salt with\\nin-blown spray. It was one of those mornings of exultation which come to\\nus rarely and only in youth, when the joy of the flesh is roused within\\nus, we know not why, and every nerve is set tingling with health--and\\nthe world, as seen through our eyes, clothes itself afresh to symbolize\\nthe gay abandon of our mood.\\n\\nThe fluttering of something white, low down by the water’s edge, caught\\nmy attention. Out of sheer idleness I became curious. It was about a\\nquarter of a mile distant when I first had sight of it. Just behind it\\nlay the battered hull of an old wreck, masts shorn away and leaning\\nover on its side. A sea-gull wheeled above the prow, flew out to sea and\\nreturned again, showing that it had been disturbed and was distressed.\\n\\nAs I approached, I discovered the white thing to be the stooping figure\\nof a child; by her hair I recognized her. Her skirts were kilted up\\nabout her tiny waist and she was bare-legged. I could see no one with\\nher, so I waited till she should look up, lest I should frighten her.\\nThen, “Hulloa, little ’un,” I shouted. “Going to let me come and play\\nwith you?”\\n\\nShe spread apart her small legs, like an infant Napoleon, and brushed\\nback the curls from her eyes. Her cheeks were flushed with exertion. She\\nlooked even prettier and more faery than she had on the previous night.\\n\\n“Why, you ith the man what found me!” she cried.\\n\\nShe made such speed as she could across the pebbles to greet me. It was\\nhard going for her bare little feet. When she came opposite to me, she\\nhalted with a solemn childish air of dignity. “I want to fank you,” she\\nsaid, “and tho doth Vi.”\\n\\nShe stood gazing at me shyly. When I bent down to take her hand in mine,\\nshe pursed her mouth, showing me what was expected.\\n\\nI asked her what she was playing. She shook her curls, at a loss for\\nwords. “Jest thomething,” she said, and invited me to come and join.\\n\\nI took her in my arms to save her the rough return journey. She showed\\nno fear of me. Soon we were chatting on the lonely beach, firm friends,\\nquite gaily together. She showed me the channel she had scooped out,\\nleading into the miniature harbor. Every time the surf ran up the shore\\nthe harbor filled with water. In the basin was a piece of wood, which\\nfloated when the surf ran in, and stranded when it receded.\\n\\n“What’s that?” I asked her.\\n\\n“That’s our thip.”\\n\\n“What’s the name of our ship?”\\n\\n“I fordet--it’s the big thip in what we came over.”\\n\\n“Who’s we?”\\n\\n“Why, me and Vi.”\\n\\nWe set to work to make the harbor wider, going on our knees side by\\nside. I thought of a fine plan--to start the ship at the beginning of\\nthe channel, that so it might ride in on the in-rush of the water. The\\nlittle girl was delighted and leant over my shoulder, brushing my face\\nwith her blown about hair, and clapping her hands as she watched\\nthe success of the experiment. In the excitement of the game, we had\\nforgotten about everyone but our two selves, when we heard a voice\\ncalling, “Dorrie, darling! Dorrie, darling! Are you all right?”\\n\\nI turned round, but could see no one--only the lonely length of the\\nshore and the black wreck blistering in the wind and sunshine.\\n\\n“Yeth, I’m all right,” piped the little girl.\\n\\nThen she explained to me, “That wath Vi.”\\n\\n“And who are you?” I asked her.\\n\\n“I’m Dorrie.”\\n\\nFor me the zest had gone out of the game. I kept turning my head, trying\\nto catch a glimpse of the owner of the voice. It had sounded so lazy and\\npleasant that I was anxious to see what Vi looked like; but then I was\\nnot sure that my company would prove so welcome to a grownup as it had\\nto Dorrie. To run away would have looked foolish--as though there were\\nsomething of which to be ashamed; and then there was nowhere to run to\\nin that wide open space. Yet my intrusion was so unconventional that I\\ndid not feel comfortable in staying.\\n\\nA slim figure in a white sailor dress came out from the wreck. She had\\nbeen bathing, for she wore neither shoes nor stockings, and her hair was\\nhanging loose about her shoulders to dry. She started at sight of me,\\nand seemed, for a moment, to hesitate as to whether she should retire. I\\nrose from my knees, holding Dorrie’s hand, and stood waiting.\\n\\nI could not help gazing at her; we looked straight into one another’s\\neyes. Hers were the color of violets, grave and loyal. They seemed to\\nstare right into my mind, reading all that I had thought and all that I\\nhad desired. Her face was of the brilliant and transparent paleness that\\ngoes with fair complexions sometimes. In contrast her lips were scarlet,\\nand her brows delicately but firmly penciled. Her features were softly\\nmolded and regular, her figure upright and lithe. She appeared brimful\\nof energy, a good deal of which was probably nervous. And her hair was\\nglorious. It was flaxen like Dorrie’s; the salt of the sea had given to\\nit a bronzy touch in the shadows. She was neither short nor tall, but\\nstraight-limbed and superbly womanly. She possessed Dorrie’s own fragile\\ndaintiness. The likeness between them was extraordinary; I judged them\\nat once to be sisters. As for her age, she looked little more than\\ntwenty.\\n\\nShe stood gazing down on me from the sullen wreck, with La Gioconda’s\\nsmile, incarnating all the purity of passion that I had ever dreamt\\nshould be mine. “Gold and ivory, with poppies for her lips,” was the\\nthought that described her.\\n\\nDorrie cut short our silence. Letting go my hand, she stumbled up the\\nbeach, explaining the situation in her lisping way. “Deareth, thith\\ngentleman hath been playing with me. He’th the man what found me\\nyetherday.”\\n\\nNoticing that neither of us uttered a word, she turned on me\\nreproachfully. “I thought you wath kind,” she said. “Come thith minute,\\nand thpeak to Vi.”\\n\\nHer air of baby imperiousness made us smile. That broke the ice.\\n\\nShe placed her arm about Dorrie, hugging her against her side. As I\\ncame up to the wreck, she held out her hand frankly. “This is very\\nunconventional,” she said, “but things sometimes happen this way. I was\\nso sorry you wouldn’t stop to let me thank you yesterday. I was hoping\\nwe would meet again.”\\n\\nIt seemed quite natural to sit down beside this stranger. Usually in the\\npresence of women I was tongue-tied and had to rack my brains to think\\nwhat to say. When the opportunity to escape came, I always took it,\\nand spent the next hour in kicking myself for having behaved like a\\nfrightened boy. On this occasion it was quite otherwise. Sprawled out\\nin the shadow of the wreck, gazing up into her girlish face while she\\ncuddled Dorrie to her, I found myself talking with a fearlessness and\\nfreedom which I was not aware of at the time.\\n\\n“You were bathing?”\\n\\nShe shook out her hair. “Looks like it?”\\n\\n“But you shouldn’t bathe here, you know. It’s dangerous. The south beach\\nis the proper place.”\\n\\n“I’m rather a good swimmer. I’m not afraid.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter. You oughtn’t to do it. You might get drowned. I’m\\nawfully serious. I wish you wouldn’t.”\\n\\nShe seemed amused at my concern for her. Yet I knew she liked it. Her\\neyes were saying to me, “Oh, you nice, funny boy! You’ve known me less\\nthan an hour. If I were to drown, what difference would it make to you?”\\n She looked down at Dorrie. “If Vi were to go out there, and sink beneath\\na wave, and never come back again, would Dorrie mind?”\\n\\n“You won’t,” said Dorrie; “don’t be thtupid.”\\n\\nWe talked about a good many things that morning as the wind blew, and\\nthe waves broke, and the sun climbed higher. I wanted to find out who\\nshe was, so that I might make certain of meeting her again.\\n\\n“Do you live in Ransby?” I asked.\\n\\n“No. We only arrived yesterday. I never was in England till a week ago.\\nWe’ve been traveling on the Continent. I wanted a place in which to be\\nquiet. I heard someone in the hotel at which we stayed in London talking\\nabout Ransby. They said it was old-world and bracing--that was why I\\ncame.”\\n\\n“I’ve never been out of England in my life,” I said; “I’d like to break\\nloose some time.”\\n\\n“Where would you go?”\\n\\nWhen we began to talk of foreign countries, she amazed me with her\\nknowledge. She seemed to have been in every country of Europe except\\nRussia. Last winter, she told me, she had spent in Rome and the spring\\nin Paris. She always spoke as if she had been unaccompanied, except\\nfor Dorrie. It struck me as strange that so young and beautiful a woman\\nshould have traveled so widely without an escort or chaperon of any\\nkind. I was striving to place her. She spoke excellent English, and yet\\nI was certain she was not an Englishwoman. For one thing, her manner in\\nconversation with a man was too spontaneous and free from embarrassment.\\nShe had none of that fear of talking about herself which hampers the\\nwomen of our nation; nor did she seek to flatter me and to hold my\\nattention by an insincere interest in my own past history. She had\\nan air of self-possession and self-poise which permitted her to make\\nherself accessible. I longed to ask her to tell me more about herself,\\nbut I did not dare. We skimmed the surface of things, evading one\\nanother’s inquisitiveness with veiled allusions.\\n\\nThe child looked up. “Dorrie’s hungry,” she said plaintively. .\\n\\nPulling out my watch I discovered that it was long past twelve. Making\\nthe greatest haste, I could not get back to my grandmother’s till lunch\\nwas over.\\n\\n“You needn’t go unless you want,” said Vi. “I’ve enough for the three of\\nus. It was Dorrie and I who delayed you; so we ought to entertain you.\\nThat’s only fair.”\\n\\nDorrie wriggled her toes and clambered over me, insisting that I accept\\nthe invitation. And so I stayed.\\n\\nThey disappeared for ten minutes inside the wreck; when they came out\\nthey had completed their dressing. Vi had piled her hair into a\\ngold wreath about her head. She was still hatless, but her feet were\\ndecorously stockinged and shod in a shiny pair of high-heeled slippers.\\n\\nWhen the meal was ended, I had told myself, I ought to take my\\ndeparture; but Dorrie gave me an excuse for stopping. She curled herself\\nup in my arms, saying she was “tho thleepy.” I could not rise without\\nwaking her.\\n\\nWhen the child no longer kept guard between us, we began to grow\\nself-conscious. In the silences which broke up our whispered\\nconversation, we took slow glances at one another and, when we caught\\none another’s eyes, looked away sharply. I thought of the miracle of\\nwhat had happened, and wondered if the same thought occupied her mind.\\nHere were she and I, who that morning had been nothing to one another;\\nby this afternoon every other interest had become dwarfed beside her.\\nI knew nothing of her. Most of the words which we had interchanged had\\nbeen quite ordinary. Yet she had revealed to me a new horizon; she had\\nmade me aware of an unsuspected intensity of manhood, which gave to the\\nwhole of life a richer tone and more poignant value.\\n\\nShe took her eyes from the sea and looked down at Dorrie. “You hold her\\nvery tenderly. You are fond of children.”\\n\\n“I suppose I am; but I didn’t know it until I met your little sister.”\\n\\nA warm tide of color spread over her pale face and throat. She leant\\nover me and kissed Dorrie. When the child opened her eyes she said,\\n“Come, darling, it’s nearly time for tea. We must be going.”\\n\\nI helped her to gather up her things, taking all the time I could in the\\nhope that she would ask me to accompany her.\\n\\nShe offered me her hand, saying, “Perhaps we shall meet again.”\\n\\n“I’m sure I hope so. Ransby is such a little place.”\\n\\n“Yes, but our movements are so uncertain. I don’t know how long we may\\nbe staying.”\\n\\n“At any rate we’ve had a good time to-day.”\\n\\n“Yes. You have been very kind. I’m sure Dorrie will remember you.\\nGood-by.”\\n\\nI watched them grow smaller across the sands, till they entered into the\\nshadow of the cliff. I had a mad impulse to pursue them--to follow them\\nat a distance and find out where they lived. How did I know that they\\nhad not vanished forever out of my life? I called myself a fool for not\\nhaving seized my opportunities, however precipitately, while they were\\nmine.\\n\\nThe wreck looked desolate now; all the romance had departed from it.\\nThe long emptiness of the shore filled me with loneliness. As I walked\\nhomeward, I strove to memorize her every tone and gesture. Their memory\\nmight be all that I should ever have of her. I was mortally afraid that\\nwe should never meet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II--I MEET HER AGAIN\\n\\nNext morning I walked along the north beach in the hope that I might\\ncatch sight of her. I was sure that she had shared my quickening of\\npassion; it was because she had felt it and been frightened by it, that\\nshe had wakened Dorrie and hurried so abruptly away. I was sufficiently\\nvain to assure myself that only the timidity of love could account for\\nthe sudden scurry of her flight.\\n\\nWith incredible short-sightedness, I had allowed them to leave me\\nwithout ascertaining their surname. My only clue, whereby I might\\ntrace them, was the abbreviated forms of their Christian names. Dorrie\\nprobably stood for Dorothy or Dorothea; Vi for Vivian or Violet.\\nDirectly after breakfast I had studied the visitors’ list in _The\\nRansby Chronicle_, hoping to come across these two Christian names in\\ncombination with the same surname. My search had been unrewarded, for\\nonly the initials of Christian names were printed and the V’s and the\\nD’s were bewilderingly plentiful.\\n\\nOn approaching the wreck I became oppressed with a nervous sense of the\\nproprieties. I was ashamed of intruding myself again. If she were there,\\nhow should I excuse my coming? That attraction to her was my only motive\\nwould be all too plain. I had at my disposal none of the social cloaks\\nof common interests and common acquaintance, which serve as a rule to\\ndisguise the primitive fact of a man’s liking for a woman. The hypocrisy\\nof pretending that a second meeting in the same place was accidental\\nwould be evident.\\n\\nWhen I got there my fears proved groundless; nervousness was followed by\\ndisappointment. The shore was deserted. I called Dorrie’s name to make\\nmy presence known; no answer came. Having reconnoitered the wreck from\\nthe outside, I entered through a hole in the prow where the beams had\\nburst asunder. Then I knew that Vi had been there that morning. The\\nsurface of the sand which had drifted in had been disturbed. It was\\nstill wet in places from her bathing and bore the imprint of her\\nfootsteps, with smaller ones running beside them which were Dorrie’s. I\\nmust have missed them by less than a hour.\\n\\nTurning back to Ransby, I determined to spend the rest of the day in\\nsearching. Surely she must be conscious of my yearning--sooner or\\nlater, even against her inclination, it would draw her to me. Even\\nnow, somewhere in the pyramided streets and alleys of the red-roofed\\nfishing-town, her steps were moving slower and her face was looking\\nback; presently she would turn and come towards me.\\n\\nAll that morning I wandered up and down the narrow streets, agitated\\nby unreasonable hopes and fears. Ransby has one main thoroughfare: from\\nPakewold to the harbor it is known as the London Road; from the harbor\\nto the upper lighthouse on the cliff it is known as the High Street.\\nLeading off from the High Street precipitously to the denes are winding\\nlanes of many steps, which are paved with flints; they are rarely more\\nthan five feet wide and run down steeply between gardens of houses. They\\nmake Ransby an easy place in which to hide. As I zigzagged to and fro\\nbetween the denes and the High Street by these narrow passages, I was\\ntormented with the thought that she might be crossing my path, time and\\nagain, without my knowing.\\n\\nAt lunch my grandmother inquired whether I had been to Woadley Hall. She\\nhad noticed how preoccupied I had been since my arrival, and attributed\\nit to over-anxiety concerning my prospects with Sir Charles.\\n\\n“The best thing you can do, my dear,” she said, “is to go along out\\nthere this afternoon. I’m not at all sure that you oughtn’t to make\\nyourself known at the Hall. At any rate, you’ve only got to meet Sir\\nCharles and he’d know you directly. There’s not an ounce of Cardover in\\nyou; you’ve got your mother’s face.”\\n\\nFalling in love is like committing crime; it tends to make you\\nsecretive. You will practise unusual deceptions and put yourself to all\\nkinds of ridiculous inconvenience to keep the sweet and shameful fact,\\nthat a woman has attracted you, from becoming known. My grandmother had\\nset her heart on my going to Woadley. There was no apparent reason why I\\nshouldn’t go. It would be much easier to make the journey, than to\\nhave to concoct some silly excuse for not having gone. So, with great\\nreluctance, I set out, having determined to get there and back with\\nevery haste, so that I might have time to resume my search for Vi before\\nnightfall.\\n\\nI had been walking upwards of an hour and was descending a curving\\ncountry lane, when I heard the smart trotting of a horse behind. The\\nbanks rose steeply on either side. The road was narrow and dusty.\\nI clambered up the bank to the right among wild flowers to let the\\nconveyance go by. It proved to be a two-wheeled governess-car, such as\\nply for hire by the Ransby Esplanade. In it were sitting Dorrie and\\nVi. Vi had her back towards me but, as they were passing, Dorrie caught\\nsight of me. She commenced to shout and wave, crying, “There he ith.\\nThere he ith.” They were going too fast on the downgrade to draw up\\nquickly, and so vanished round a bend. Then I heard that they had\\nhalted.\\n\\nAs I came up with the conveyance, Dorrie reached out her arms\\nimpulsively and hugged me. She was all excitement. Before anything could\\nbe said, she began to scold me. “Naughty man. I wanted you to play thips\\nwith me thith morning, like you did yetherday.”\\n\\nI was looking across the child’s shoulder at Vi. Her color had risen.\\nI could swear that beneath her gentle attitude of complete control her\\nheart was beating wildly. Her eyes told a tale. They had a startled,\\nfrightened, glad expression, and were extremely bright.\\n\\n“I should have liked to play with you, little girl,” I said, “but I\\ndidn’t know where you were staying. I looked for you this morning, but\\ncouldn’t find you.”\\n\\n“Dorrie seems to think that you belong to her,” said Vi, in her laughing\\nvoice. “She’s a little bit spoilt, you know. If she wants anything, she\\nwants it badly. She can’t wait. So, when we didn’t run across you, she\\nbegan to worry herself sick. If we hadn’t found you, I expect there’d\\nhave been an advertisement in to-morrow’s paper for the young man who\\nplayed ships with a little girl on the north beach.”\\n\\n“You won’t go away again,” coaxed Dorrie, patting my face.\\n\\n“Where are you walking?” asked Vi.\\n\\n“To Woadley.”\\n\\n“That’s where we’re going, so if you don’t mind the squeeze, you’d\\nbetter get in and ride.”\\n\\nA governess-car is made to seat four, but they have to be people of\\nreasonable size. The driver’s size was not reasonable. Good Ransby ale\\nand a sedentary mode of life had swelled him out breadthwise, so that\\nthere was no room left on his side of the carriage except for a child;\\nconsequently I took my seat by Vi.\\n\\nThe driver thought he knew me, but was still a little doubtful in his\\nmind. With honest, Suffolk downrightness, he immediately commenced to\\nask questions.\\n\\n“You bain’t a Ransby man, be you, sir?”\\n\\n“I’m a half-and-half.”\\n\\n“Thought I couldn’t ’a’ been mistooken. I’ve lived in Ransby man and\\nboy, and I never forgets a face. Which ’alf of you might be Ransby?”\\n\\n“I’m Ransby all through on my parents’ side, but I’ve lived away.”\\n\\n“Why, you bain’t Mr. Cardover, be you--gran’son to old Sir Charles?”\\n\\n“You’ve guessed right.”\\n\\n“Well, I never! And to think that you should be goin’ to Woadley! Why, I\\nknew your Ma well, Mr. Cardover; The gay Miss Fannie Evrard, we called\\n’er. Meanin’ no disrespec’ to you, sir, I was groom to Miss Fannie all\\nthem years ago, before she run away with your father. She were as nice\\nand kind a mistress as ever a man might ’ope to find. It’s proud I am\\nto meet you this day.”\\n\\nAs we bowled along through the leafy country, all shadows and sunshine,\\nhe fell to telling me about my mother, and I was glad to listen to\\nwhat he had to say. The story had been told often before. By his\\ninside knowledge of the elopement, he had acquired that kind of local\\nimportance which money cannot buy. It had provided him with the one\\ngleam of lawless romance that had kindled up the whole of his otherwise\\ndull life. According to his account, the marriage would never have come\\noff, unless he had connived at the courting. My mother, he said, took\\nhim into her confidence, and he was the messenger between her and my\\nfather. He would let my father know in which direction they intended to\\nride. When they came to the place of trysting, he would drop behind and\\nmy mother would go on alone. He pointed with his whip to some of the\\nmeeting-places with an air of pride. He was godfather, as you might say,\\nto the elopement. After it had taken place, Sir Charles had discovered\\nhis share in it, and had dismissed him. The word had gone the round\\namong the county gentry--he had never been able to find another\\nsituation. So he had bought himself a governess-car and pony, and had\\nplied for hire. “And I bain’t sorry, sir,” he said. “If it were to do\\nagain, I should be on the lovers’ side. I’m only sorry I ’ad to take\\nto drivin’ instead o’ ridin’; it makes a feller so ’eavy.”\\n\\nVi laughed at me out of the corners of her eyes. She had listened\\nintently. I felt, without her telling me, that this little glimpse into\\nmy private history had roused her kindness. And the affair had its comic\\nside--that this mountain of flesh sitting opposite should be my first\\nambassador to her, bearing my credentials of respectability.\\n\\n“Ha’ ye heerd about Lord Halloway?” he inquired.\\n\\nI nodded curtly. Encouraged by my former sympathetic attention, he\\nfailed to take the intended warning.\\n\\n“Thar’s a young rascal for ye, for all ’e ’olds ’is ’ead so\\n’igh! Looks more’n likely now that you’ll be the nex’ master o’\\nWoadley. Doan’t it strike you that way, sir?”\\n\\nWhen I maintained silence, he carried on a monologue with himself. “And\\n’e war goin’ to Woadley, he war. And I picks ’un up by h’axcident\\nlike. And I war groom to ’is ma. Wery strange!”\\n\\nBut there were stranger things than that, to my way of thinking: and\\nthe strangest of all was my own condition of mind. A golden, somnolent\\ncontent had come over me, as though my life had broken off short, and\\ncommenced afresh on a higher plane. Every motive I had ever had for good\\nwas strengthened. The old grinding problems were either solved or seemed\\nnegligible. I saw existence in its largeness of opportunity, and I\\nsaw its opportunity in a woman’s eyes. It was as though I had been\\ncolorblind, and had been suddenly gifted with sight so penetrating that\\nit enabled me to look into exquisite distances and there discern all the\\nsubtle and marvelous disintegrations of light.\\n\\nAs the car swung round corners or rattled over rough places, our bodies\\nwere thrown into closer contact as we sat together, Vi and I. Now her\\nshoulder would lurch against mine; now she would throw out her hand\\nto steady herself, and I would wonder at its smallness. I watched the\\ndemure sweetness of her profile, and how the sun and shadows played\\ntricks with her face and throat. The fragrance of her hair came to me. I\\nfollowed the designed daintiness of the little gold curls that clustered\\nwith such apparent carelessness against the whiteness of her forehead. I\\nnoticed the flicker of the long lashes which hid and revealed her\\neyes. How perishable she was, like a white hyacinth, or a summer’s\\nmorning--and how remotely divine.\\n\\nAnd the tantalizing fascination of it all was that I must be restrained.\\nShe might escape me any day.\\n\\nIn a hollow of the country from between the hedges, Woadley crept into\\nsight. First we saw the gray Norman tower of the church, smothered\\nin ivy; then the thatched roofs of the outlying cottages; then the\\nsun-flecked whiteness of the village-walls, with tall sunflowers and\\nhollyhocks peeping over them.\\n\\nAs we passed the churchyard the driver slowed down. “Thar’s the last\\nplace your father met ’er, Mr. Cardover, before they run away. It\\nwar a summer evenin’ about this time o’ the year, and they stayed for\\nupwards o’ an hour together in the porch. She’d told old Sir Charles\\nthat she war goin’ to put flowers on ’er mawther’s grave. Aye, but she\\nlooked beautiful; she war a fine figure o’ a lady.”\\n\\nI told him I would alight there. He was closing the door, on the point\\nof driving on, when I said to Vi, “Wouldn’t you like to get out as well?\\nThe church is worth a visit.”\\n\\nShe gave me her hand and I helped her down. The governess-car went\\nforward to the village inn.\\n\\nThey had been scything the grass in the churchyard and the air was full\\nof its cool fragrance. Dorrie ran off to gather daisies in a corner\\nwhere it still stood rank and high.\\n\\nWe walked up the path together to the porch and tried the door. It was\\nlocked. We turned away into the sunlight, where dog-roses climbed over\\nneglected graves and black-birds fluttered from headstones to bushes,\\nfrom bushes to the moss-covered surrounding walls.\\n\\nIt was Vi who broke the pleasant silence. “I hope you didn’t mind the\\nman talking.”\\n\\n“Not at all. I expect I should have told you myself by and by.”\\n\\n“Your mother must have been very beautiful. I like to think of her.\\nAll this country seems so different now I know about her; it was so\\nimpersonal before. Was--was she happy afterwards?”\\n\\nI told her. I told her much more than I realized at the time. So few\\npeople had ever cared to hear me talk about her, and for all of them\\nshe was something past--dead and gone. My grandmother talked of her as\\na lottery-ticket; so did the Spuffler; at home we never mentioned her at\\nall. Yet always she had been a real presence in my life. I felt jealous\\nfor her; it seemed to me that she must be glad when we, whom she had\\nloved, remembered her with kindness.\\n\\nDorrie came back to us with her lap full of flowers. Seeing that we were\\ntalking seriously, she seated herself quietly beside us and commenced to\\nweave the flowers into a chain.\\n\\nThe gate creaked. Footsteps came up the path. They paused; seemed to\\nhesitate; came forward again. Behind us they halted. Turning my head,\\nI saw an erect old man, white-haired, standing hat in hand, his back\\ntoward us, regarding a weather-beaten grave.\\n\\nWe rose, instinctively feeling our presence irreverent. My eye caught\\nthe name on the headstone of the grave:\\n\\n                   MARY FRANCES EVRARD\\n\\n               BELOVED WIFE OF SIR CHARLES EVRARD\\n\\n                   OF WOADLEY HALL\\n\\nThe old gentleman put on his hat, preparing to move away. Recognizing\\nour intention to give him privacy, he turned and bowed with stiff,\\nold-fashioned courtesy.\\n\\nI gazed on him fascinated. It was the first time I had seen my\\ngrandfather. His eyes fell full on my face.\\n\\nHis was one of the most remarkable faces I have ever gazed on. He was\\nclean shaven; his skin was ashy. His features were ascetic, boldly\\nchiseled and yet sensitively fine. They seemed to remodel themselves\\nwith startling rapidity to express the thought that was passing in\\nhis mind. The forehead was bony, high, and wrinkled. The nose was\\nlarge-nostriled and aquiline. The eye-brows were shaggy; beneath\\nthem burnt sparks of fire, steady and almost cruel in their scorching\\npenetration. From the nostrils to the corners of the mouth two heavy\\nlines cut deep into the flesh, creating an expression of haughty\\ncontemplation and aloof sadness. The mouth was prominent, fulllipped,\\nand almost sensual, had it not been so delicately shaped. The chin\\nwas long, pointed, and sank into the breast. It was an actor’s face,\\na poet’s face, a rejected prophet’s face, according to the mood which\\nanimated it. When the lines deepened into sneering melancholy and the\\ncorners of the large mouth drooped, it became almost Jewish. The strong\\nwill that was always striving to cast the outward appearance into an\\nexpression of immobile pride, was continually being thwarted by the\\nman’s quivering, abnormal capacity to feel and to be wounded.\\n\\nHe stared at me in troubled amazement. Yearning, despairing tenderness\\nfought its way into his eyes; for an instant, his whole expression\\nrelaxed and softened. He had recognized my mother in me and was\\nremembering. He made a step towards me. Then his face went rigid again.\\nThe skin drew tight over the cheek-bones. Setting his hat firmly on his\\nhead, he turned upon his heel. At the gate he looked back once, against\\nhis will. Then he passed out resolutely and vanished down the road.\\n\\nTwilight was gathering as we drove back to Ransby. Rays of the sun crept\\naway from us westward through the meadows, like golden snakes. Vi and I\\nwere silent--the presence of the driver put a constraint upon us.\\n\\nHe had a good deal to say, for he had warned all the village of my\\narrival, and all the village, furtively from behind curtained windows,\\nhad watched Sir Charles’s journey to and from the churchyard.\\n\\nIt had been pleasant at the inn to hear myself addressed as “Miss\\nFannie’s son.” The windows of the low-ceilinged room in which we had\\nhad our tea, faced out on the tall iron gates which gave entrance to\\nthe park. Far up the driveway, hidden behind elms, we had just caught\\na glimpse of Woadley Hall. And all the while we were eating, the\\nbroad-hipped landlady had stood guard over us, talking about my mother\\nand the good old days. She had mistaken Vi for my wife at first; in\\nspeaking to Dorrie she had referred to me as “your Papa.” Up to the last\\nshe had persisted in including Vi and Dorrie in her prophecies for my\\nfuture. She never doubted that Vi and I were engaged. She assured us\\nthat she ’oped to see us at the ’All one day, and a ’andsome\\ncouple we would make.\\n\\nAt the time we had been abashed by her conversation, and had drunk our\\ntea in flustered fashion with our eyes in our cups. We had hated this\\nbig complacent person for her clumsy, interfering kindness. But now,\\nas the little carriage threaded its way through dusky lanes, her errors\\ngave rise to a pleasant train of imaginings. I saw Vi as my wife--as\\nLady Cardover, mistress of Woadley Hall. I planned the doings of\\nour days, from the horse-back ride in the early morning to the quiet\\nevenings together by the cozy fire. And why could it not be possible?\\n\\nCountry lovers, unashamed, with arms encircling one another, drew aside\\nto let us pass, as our lamps flashed down the road. Night birds were\\ncalling. Meadowsweet and wild thyme spread their fragrance abroad. As\\nthe wind blew inland, between great silences, it carried to our ears the\\nmoan of the sea. While twilight hovered in the open spaces Dorrie, since\\nno one talked to her, kept up an undercurrent song:\\n\\n                   “How far is it to Babylon?\\n\\n                   _Three score miles and ten_.\\n\\n                   Can I get there by candlelight?\\n\\n                   _Ah yes,--and back again._”\\n\\nAs night crept on, the piping little voice grew indistinct and\\nmurmurous, like a bee humming; the fair little head nodded and sank\\nagainst the arm of the bulky driver. Vi leant forward to lift her into\\nher lap; but I took Dorrie from her. With the child in my arms, for the\\nfirst time the desire to be a father came over me. In thinking of what\\nlove might mean, I had never thought of that.\\n\\nWe entered Ransby at the top of the High Street and drew up outside an\\nold black flint house. Vi got out first and rang the bell. When the door\\nopened, I put Dorrie into her arms. I bent over and kissed the sleeping\\nchild. Vi drew back her head sharply; my lips had passed so near to\\nhers. We faced one another on the threshold. The light from the hall,\\nfalling on her face, showed me that her lips were parted as though she\\nhad something that she was trying to get said. Then, “Good-night.” she\\nwhispered, and the door closed behind her.\\n\\nI crossed the street and wandered to and fro, watching the house. All\\nthe front was in darkness; her rooms must be at the back. I was greedy\\nfor her presence; if I could only see her shadow pass before a window I\\nwould be content. With the closing of the door, she seemed to have shut\\nme out of her life. There was so much to say, and nothing had been said.\\n\\nI turned out of the High Street down a long dark score, toward the\\nbeach. Walls rose tall on either side. The salt wind, hurrying up\\nthe narrow passage, struck me in the face and caused the gas-lamps\\nto quiver. Far down the tunnel at the end of the steps lay a belt of\\nblackness, and beyond that the tossing lights of ships at sea.\\n\\nReaching the Beach Road, I passed over the denes. The town stretched\\ntall across the sky, like a shadowy curtain through which peered golden\\neyes. The revolving light of the lighthouse on the denes pointed a long\\nwhite finger inland, till its tip rested on the back of Vi’s house. I\\nfancied I saw her figure at the window. The finger swept on in a circle\\nout to sea, leaving the town in darkness. The upper-light on the cliff\\nreplied, pointing to the place where I was standing, making it bright as\\nday. If she were still at the window, she would be able to see me as\\nI had seen her. Next time her window was illumined she had vanished. I\\nwatched and waited; she did not return.\\n\\nI roamed along the shore towards the harbor, purposeless with desire.\\nThe sea, like a blind old man, kept whimpering to itself, trying to drag\\nitself up the beach, clutching at the sand with exhausted fingers.\\n\\nWearied out with wandering, I turned my steps homeward. The shop looked\\nso dark that I was ashamed to ring the bell lest they had all retired.\\nI tapped on the shutters, and heard a shuffling inside; my grandmother\\nopened the door to me. She was in her dressing-gown and a turkey-red\\npetticoat. The servant had been in bed some hours.\\n\\nIn the keeping-room I found a supper spread. Instead of being annoyed,\\nshe was bubbling over with excitement. She could not sit down, but\\nstood over my chair while I ate; she was sure something wonderful had\\nhappened.\\n\\n“So you saw Sir Charles, my boy, and he recognized you! Tell me\\neverything, chapter and verse, with all the frills and furbelows.”\\n\\nI had not much that I could tell, but I spread it out to satisfy her.\\n\\n“And what did you think of ’im?” she asked. “Isn’t he every inch the\\naristocrat?”\\n\\n“Yes. But why is he so dark? There are times when he looks almost\\nJewish.”\\n\\n“Why, my dear, that’s ’cause he’s got gipsy-blood. His mother was one\\nof the Goliaths. Didn’t your father ever tell you that? Seems to me he\\ndon’t tell you nothing. You have to come to your poor old Grannie\\nto learn anything. Why, yes, old Sir Oliver Evrard, his father, your\\ngreatgrandfather, fell in love with a gipsy fortune-teller and married\\n’er. Ever since then the gipsies have been allowed to camp on Woadley\\nHam. They do say that it was the wild gipsy streak that made your mother\\ndo what she did. But there--that’s a long story. It’ll keep. We’d better\\ngo to bed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III--FATE\\n\\nI could not understand Vi. It would seem that she was trying to avoid\\nme. If I met her in the street she was usually driving and, while she\\nbowed and smiled, never halted. I took many strolls by her house, hoping\\nto catch her going in or out. I think she must have watched me. Once\\nonly, when she thought the coast was clear, I came upon her just as she\\nwas leaving the house. She saw me and flushed gloriously; then pretended\\nthat she had not seen me and re-entered, closing the door hurriedly\\nbehind her.\\n\\nAfter that I gave up my pursuit of her. It seemed not\\nstraightforward--too much like spying. I kept away from the places\\nshe was likely to frequent. Wandering the quays, where there were only\\nsailors and red-capped Brittany onion-sellers, I racked my brains,\\ntrying to recall in what I had offended. I felt no resentment for Vi’s\\nconduct. It never occurred to me that she was a coquette. I thought\\nthat she might be actuated by a woman’s caution, and gave her credit\\nfor motives of which I had no knowledge. The more she withdrew beyond my\\nattainment, the more desirable she became to me.\\n\\nMy grandmother noticed my fallen countenance and concluded that Sir\\nCharles’s indifference was the cause of it. She tried to cheer me with\\nfragments of wise sayings which had helped her to keep her courage. She\\ntold me that there were more fish in the sea than ever came out of it.\\nShe even feigned contempt for Sir Charles, saying that I should probably\\nbe just as happy without his begrudged money. She resorted to religion\\nfor comfort, saying that if God didn’t intend me to inherit Woadley, it\\nwas because it wouldn’t be good for me. She painted for me the pleasures\\nof the contented life:\\n\\n               “No riches I covet, no glory I want,\\n\\n               H’ambition is nothing to me;\\n\\n               The one thing I beg of kind ’eaven to grant\\n\\n               Is a mind independent and free.”\\n\\nBut she couldn’t stir me out of my melancholy, for she didn’t know its\\ncause. She physicked me for financial disappointments; what I wanted was\\na love-antidote.\\n\\nAs my whole energies had formerly been bent on encountering Vi, so now\\nthey were directed towards avoiding her. For hours I would lounge in\\nthe bake-house or sit in the shop while Grandmother Cardover did her\\nknitting, served customers, or gossiped with her neighbors. Then,\\nagainst my better judgment, curiosity and longing for one more glimpse\\nof her would drag me out into the streets. Yet, once in the streets, my\\nchief object was to flee from her.\\n\\nNow when I should have refrained from pestering her, some obstinate fate\\nwas always bringing us face to face. I was sorriest for the effect that\\nour attitude was having on Dorrie. At first she would rush forward in\\na gale of high spirits to greet me, until restrained by Vi. Next time,\\nwith a child’s forgetfulness, she would lift to me her <DW29>-face\\nsmiling, and remembering would hang back. At last she grew afraid of my\\ntroubled looks, and would hide shyly behind Vi’s skirts when she saw me.\\n\\nFor five days I had not met them. A desperate suspicion that they had\\nleft town grew upon me. I became reckless in my desire for certainty.\\nI could not bear the suspense. I was half-minded to call at the house\\nwhere she had been staying, but that did not seem fair to her. I called\\nmyself a fool for not having stopped her in the street while I had the\\nchance, when an explanation and an apology might have set everything on\\na proper footing.\\n\\nOn the sixth morning of her absence I rose early and went out before\\nbreakfast. The skies were gray and squally. A slow drizzle had been\\nfalling all night and, though it now had ceased, the pavements were wet.\\nThe wind came in gusts, whistling round corners of streets and houses,\\nwhirling scraps of paper high in the air. When I came to the harbor, I\\nsaw that the sea was choppy and studded with white horses. Against the\\npiles of the pier waves were dashing and shattering into spray. From up\\nchannel, all along the horizon, drove long lines of leaden clouds.\\n\\nI struck out across the denes between the sea-wall and the Beach\\nRoad. No one was about. I braced myself against the wind, enjoying its\\nstinging coldness. The tormented loneliness of the scene was in accord\\nwith my mood. The old town, hanging red along the cliff, no longer\\nseemed to watch me; it frowned out on the desolate waste of water in\\nimpersonal defiance.\\n\\nMy thoughts were full of that first morning when I had met her. I gave\\nmy imagination over without restraint to reconstructing its sensuous\\nbeauty. I saw the fire of the furze again, and scented the far-blown\\nfragrance of wall-flowers, hiding in their crannies. But I saw as the\\ncenter of it all the slim white girl with the mantle of golden hair,\\nthe deep inscrutable eyes of violet, and the slow sweet smile of _La\\nGioconda_ playing round the edges of her mouth: gold and ivory, with\\npoppies for her lips and sunshine for a background.\\n\\nThe hot blood in me was up--the gipsy blood. A stream of impassioned\\nfancies passed before me. Ah, if I were to meet her now, I would have\\ndone with fine-spun theories of what was gentlemanly. On the lonely\\nbeach I would throw my arms about her, however she struggled, and\\nhold her fast till she lay with her dear face looking up, crushed and\\nsubmissive in my breast. After that she might leave me, but she would at\\nleast have learnt that I was a man and that I loved her.\\n\\nAhead lay the sullen wreck. I had been there only once since our first\\nmeeting. Motives of delicacy, which I now regretted, had held me back.\\nNow I could go there. On such a morning, though she were still in\\nRansby, there would be no fear of surprising her.\\n\\nOn entering the hull through the hole in the prow, the wind ceased,\\nthough it whistled overhead. I leant against the walls of the stranded\\nship, recovering my breath. I drew out my pipe, intending to take a\\nsmoke while I rested. As I turned to strike a match, an open umbrella\\nlying in a corner on the sand, caught my attention. I went over and\\nlooked behind it; there lay a pair of woman’s shoes and stockings, and a\\njacket, with stones placed on it to keep it down. Beneath the jacket was\\na disordered pile of woman’s clothing.\\n\\nMy first thought was shame of what she might think of me, were she to\\nfind me. My second was of angry fear because she had been so foolhardy\\nas to bathe from such a shore on such a morning.\\n\\nHurrying out of the wreck, I strode across the beach to where the\\nsurf rushed boiling up the pebbles. The waves ran high, white, and\\nfoam-capped, hammering against the land. Gazing out from shore, I could\\nsee nothing but leaden water, rising and falling, rising and falling.\\nThe height of the waves might hide a swimmer from one standing at the\\nwater’s level; I raced back up the beach, and climbed the wreck. I could\\nnot discover her. The horror of what this meant stunned me; I could\\nthink of nothing else. My mind was in confusion. Then I heard my voice\\nrepeating over and over that she was not dead. The sheer monotony of the\\nreiterated assertion, produced a sudden, unnatural clearness. “If she is\\nnot drowned, she must be somewhere out there,” I said.\\n\\nI commenced to sweep the sea with my eyes in ever widening circles. Two\\nhundred yards down the shore to the left and about fifty out, I sighted\\nsomething. It was white and seemed only foam at first. The crest of a\\nwave tossed it high for a second, then shut it out; when the next wave\\nrose it was still there.\\n\\nI shouted, but my voice would not carry against the wind. The next time\\nthe white thing rose on the crest I was sure that it was the face of a\\nwoman. I saw her arm thrown out above the surface; she was swimming the\\noverarm stroke in an effort to make headway toward the land. I knew\\nthat she could never do it, for the current along the north beach runs\\nseawards and the tide was going out. I gazed round in panic. The shore\\nwas forlorn and deserted. Behind me to the northward stretched the\\ngaunt, bare cliffs. To the southward, a mile distant across the denes,\\nstood the outskirts of the sleepy town. Before ever I could bring help,\\nshe would have been carried exhausted far out to sea, or else drowned.\\nThere was no boat on the shore between myself and the harbor. There was\\nnothing between her and death but myself. And to go to her rescue meant\\ndeath.\\n\\nI scarcely know what happened. I became furious with unreasonable anger.\\nI was angry with her for her folly, and angry with the world because it\\ntook no notice and did not care. I was determined that, before it was\\ntoo late, I would go to her, so that she might understand. Yet, despite\\nmy passion, I acted with calculation and cunning. All my attention\\nwas focused on that speck of white, bobbing in the waste of churned up\\nblackness. As I ran along the beach I kept my eyes fixed on that. When I\\ncame opposite, I waved to it. It took no notice. I hurried on a hundred\\nyards further; the current would bear her down towards me northwards. I\\nstripped almost naked, tearing off everything that would weigh me down.\\nI waded knee-deep into the surf, up to where the beach shelved suddenly.\\nI waited till a roller was on the point of breaking; diving through it,\\nI struck out.\\n\\nIt was difficult to see her. Only when the waves threw us high at the\\nsame moment, did I catch a glimpse of her and get my direction.\\nThe shock of the icy coldness of the water steadied my nerves and\\nconcentrated my purpose. I was governed by a single determination--to\\nget to her. My thought went no further than that. Nothing else mattered.\\nI had no fear of death or of what might come after--I had no time to\\nthink about it. I wanted to get her in my arms and shake her, and tell\\nher what a little fool she was, and kiss her on the mouth.\\n\\nLying on my right side, keeping low in the water, I dug my way forward\\nwith an over-arm left-stroke. As my first wind went from me and I waited\\nfor my second, I settled down into the long plugging stroke of a mile\\nrace. The tide was with me, but the roughness of the water prevented\\nrapid progress. I had to get far enough out to be at the point below her\\nin the current to which she was being swept down.\\n\\nI started counting from one to ten to keep myself from slackening, just\\nas the cox of a racing-eight does when he forces his crew to swing out.\\nI regarded my body impersonally, without sympathy, as though we were\\nseparate. When it suffered and the muscles ached, I lashed it forward\\nwith my will, silently deriding it with brutal profanities. The wind\\npoured over the sea; the spray dashed up and nearly choked me. It was\\ndifficult to keep her in sight. When I saw her again, I smiled grimly at\\nher courage and hit up a quicker pace. Who would have thought that her\\nfragile body, so flower-like and dainty, had the strength and nerve to\\nfight like that?\\n\\nI was far enough out now to catch her. I halted, treading water; but\\nthe inaction gave my imagination time to get to work, and, when that\\nhappened, I felt myself weakening. I started up against the current,\\ngoing parallel with the beach, to meet her. The one obsessing thought\\nin my mind was to get to her. It was not so much a thought as an animal\\ninstinct. I was reduced to the primitive man, brutally battling his way\\ntowards his mate at a time of danger. While I acted instinctively, the\\nflesh responded; directly I paused to think, my body began to shirk and\\nmy strength to ebb. Somewhere in that raging waste of water I must find\\nand touch her. I did not care to hear her voice--simply to hold her.\\n\\nThirty feet away a gray riot of stampeding water rose against the\\nhorizon; in it I saw her face. With the swift trudging stroke of a\\npolo-player I made towards her. In the foam and spray I saw what looked\\nlike golden seaweed. She was drifting past me; I caught her by the hair.\\nOut of the mist of driven chaos we gazed in one another’s eyes. Her lips\\nmoved. “You!” she said.\\n\\nMy mind was laughing in triumph. My body was no longer weary--it was\\nforgotten and strong again. In all the world there were just she and I.\\nShe had tried to escape me, but now the waves jostled us together. She\\nhad striven not to see me, but now my face focused all her gaze. She\\nmight look away into the smoking crest of the next roller, but her eyes\\nmust always come back. Of all live things we had loved or hated,\\nnow there remained just she and I. We had been stripped of all our\\nacquirements and thrown back to the primitive basis of existence--a\\nman and a woman fighting for life in chaos. For us all the careful\\nconventions, built up by centuries, were suddenly destroyed. The polite\\ndecencies and safeguards of civilization were swept aside. The shame of\\nso many natural things, which had made up the toll of our refinement,\\nwas contemptuously blotted out--the architecture of the ages was\\nshattered in an instant. We were thrown back to where the first man\\nand woman started. The only virtue that remained to us was the physical\\nstrength by which death might be avoided. The sole distinguishing\\ncharacteristic between us was the female’s dependence on the male, and\\nthe male’s native instinct to protect her, if need be savagely with his\\nlife. Over there, a mile away, stood the red comfortable town on the\\ncliff, where all the smug decencies were respected which we had perforce\\nabandoned. Between us and the shore stretched fifty yards of water--a\\ngulf between the finite and the infinite. Over there lay the moment of\\nthe present; here in eternity were she and I.\\n\\nI gazed on her with stern gladness; I had got to her--she was mine. The\\nmadness for possession, which had given me strength, was satisfied. Now\\na fresh motive, still instinctive and primal, urged me on--I must save\\nher. I lifted her arm and placed it across my shoulder, so that I might\\nsupport her. The great thing was to keep her afloat as long as possible.\\nThere was no going back over the path that we had traversed--both\\ntide and current were dead against us. Already the shore was stealing\\naway--we were being carried out to sea.\\n\\nI remembered, how on that first morning, when I had warned her against\\nbathing from the north beach, she had told me she was a good swimmer. In\\nmy all-embracing ignorance of her, I had no means of estimating how\\nmuch or how little that meant. For myself, barring accidents, I judged I\\ncould keep going for two hours.\\n\\nVi was weakening. With her free left hand she was still swimming\\npluckily, but her right hand kept slipping off my shoulder; I had to\\nwatch her sharply and lift it back. Her weight became heavier. Her lips\\nwere blue and chattering. I noticed that her fingers were spread apart;\\nshe had cramp in the palms of her hands. Her body dragged beside me; she\\nwas losing control of it. She was no longer kicking out.\\n\\nTo talk, save in monosyllables, was impossible, and then one had to\\nshout. Our ears were stopped up with water; the clash of the wind\\nagainst the waves was deafening. My one fear for her was that the cramp\\nwould spread. If that happened, we would go down together.\\n\\nI felt her cold lips pressed against my shoulder. As I looked round, she\\nlet go of me. “I’m done,” she said.\\n\\nShe went under. I slipped my arm about her and turned over on my back,\\nso that my body floated under her, and she lay across my breast. “You\\nshan’t go,” I panted furiously.\\n\\n“Let me,” she pleaded.\\n\\nBut I held her. “You shan’t go,” I said.\\n\\nMy anger roused her. I turned over again, swimming the breast-stroke.\\nShe placed her arm round my neck. Her long hair washed about me.\\n\\nSometimes her eyes were closed and I thought she had fainted. Her lips\\nhad ceased to chatter. Her face lay against my shoulder, pinched and\\nquiet as though she were dead. My own motions were becoming mechanical.\\nIt was sheer lust of life that kept me going. I had lost sensation in my\\nfeet and hands. The shore had dwindled behind us; it seemed very small\\nand blurred, though it was probably only half-a-mile distant. The water\\nwas less turbulent now; it rose and fell, rose and fell, with a rocking\\nrestfulness. I felt that I would soon be sleeping soundly. But in the\\nmidst of drowsing, my mind would spring up alert and I would drag her\\narm closer about my neck.\\n\\nAbove the clamor of the waves I heard a shout. At first I thought that I\\nhad given it myself. I heard it again; it was unmistakable.\\n\\nLooking up out of the trough of a wave, I saw a patched sail hanging\\nover us. My sight was misty; the sail was indistinct and yet near me. As\\nI rose on the crest, a hand grabbed me and I felt myself lifted out on\\nto a pile of nets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV--THE TRUTH ABOUT HER\\n\\n\\nThar, lad, lie still. Yow’ll be ’ome direc’ly.”\\n\\nThe gray-bearded man at the tiller smiled to me in a friendly manner. He\\ndidn’t seem at all excited, but took all that had happened stoically,\\nas part of the day’s work. Seeing me gaze round questioningly, he added,\\n“The lassie’s well enough, Mr. Cardover. She’ll come round. A mouthful\\no’ salt water won’t ’urt ’er.”\\n\\nI wondered vaguely how he knew my name. Then, as my brain cleared, I\\nremembered him as one of the fishermen who called in at my grandmother’s\\nshop for an occasional chat, seated on a barrel.\\n\\nI raised myself on my elbow. We were rounding the pier-head, running\\ninto the harbor. I was in a little shrimping-boat. The nets hung out\\nover the stern. The old man at the tiller was in oilskins and a younger\\nman was shortening sail.\\n\\nI felt sick, and giddy, and stiff. A tarpaulin was thrown over me. I\\ntried to recollect how I came there. Then I saw Vi lying near me in the\\nbows. A sailor’s coat was wrapped about her. Her hair lay piled in a\\ngolden heap over her white throat and breast. Her eyes were closed. The\\nblueness of the veins about her temples enhanced her pallor. I made\\nan effort to crawl towards her; but the motion of the boat and my own\\nweakness sent me sprawling.\\n\\nPeople from the pier-head had seen us. As we stole up the harbor,\\nquestions were shouted to the man at the tiller and answers shouted\\nback. When we drew in at the quayside an excited crowd had gathered.\\nTo every newcomer the account was given of how Joe Tuttle, as ’e war\\na-beating up to the ’arbor, comed across them two a-driftin’ off the\\nnor’ beach, ’alf a mile or so from land.\\n\\nCoats were torn off and folded round us. Someone was sent ahead to warn\\nneighbor Cardover of what she must expect. Vi was tenderly lifted out\\nand carried down the road in the arms of Joe Tuttle. I was hoisted like\\na sack across the shoulders of our younger rescuer. Accompanying us was\\na shouting, jabbering, eager crowd, anxious to tell everyone we passed\\nwhat had happened. My most distinct recollection is the shame I felt of\\nthe bareness of my dangling legs.\\n\\nThe tramp of heavy feet invaded the shop. I heard the capable voice\\nof Grandmother Cardover getting rid of sightseers. “Now then, my good\\npeople, there’s nothing ’ere for you. Out you go; you’re not wanted in\\nmy shop. Thank goodness, we can worry along without your ’elp.” Then\\nI heard her in a lower voice giving directions for us to be carried\\nupstairs.\\n\\nHot blankets, brought from the bake-house oven, were soon about me and I\\nwas tucked safe in bed. I have a faint recollection of the doctor coming\\nand of hot spirits being forced down my throat. Then they left me alone\\nand I fell into the deep sleep of utter weariness.\\n\\nWhen I awoke, the room was in darkness and a fire was burning. I felt\\nlazy and comfortable. I turned on my side and found that I was alone.\\nI began to think back. The thought that filled my mind seemed a\\ncontinuation of what I had been dreaming. I was in the trough of a wave,\\nthe sea was washing over me, Vi’s arm was heavy about my neck, and her\\nlips were kissing my shoulder. I looked round; her eyes shone into mine,\\nand her hair swayed loose about her like the hair of a mermaiden. I\\nlistened. There were footsteps on the stair. The door opened and my\\ngrandmother tiptoed to the bed.\\n\\nI raised myself up. The torpor cleared from my brain. Before the\\nquestion could frame itself, my grandmother had answered it. “She’s all\\nright, Dante; she’s in the spare bedroom and sleeping soundly.”\\n\\nShe seated herself beside me and slipped her wrinkled old hand into mine\\nbeneath the bed-clothes. She sat in silence for some minutes. The light\\nfrom the street-lamp shining in at the window, fell upon her. I could\\nsee her gray curls wabbling, the way they always did when she was\\nagitated. At last she spoke. “How did it ’appen, Dante?”\\n\\nI told her.\\n\\n“Then you knowed ’er before?”\\n\\nLittle by little I gave her all the story.\\n\\n“A nice young rascal you are,” she said; “and a pretty way you’ve got\\no’ love-making. You beat your own father, that you do. And what’s her\\nname?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n“He doesn’t know!” She laughed till the tears ran down her face. “And I\\nsuppose you think you’re goin’ to marry ’er?”\\n\\n“I know I am.”\\n\\n“Well, the sooner the better I say. Judging by her looks, you might\\n’ave chose worse. When it comes to wimmen, the Evrards and the\\nCardovers are mad.”\\n\\nShe went downstairs to get me some supper. I had given her Vi’s address,\\nthat she might send off a message to Vi’s landlady. Poor little Dorrie\\nmust be beside herself by now, wondering what had happened.\\n\\nWhile I ate my supper, my grandmother kept referring to what I had\\ntold her. She was very proud and happy. Her eyes twinkled behind her\\nspectacles. I had added an entirely original chapter to the history of\\nour family’s romance. “I keep wishin’,” she said, “that your dear ma ’ad\\nbeen alive. It would just ’a’ suited her.”\\n\\nThe morning broke bright and sunny. I insisted on getting up to\\nbreakfast. I was a trifle stiff, but apart from that none the worse\\nfor my experience. It was odd to think that Vi was sleeping in the same\\nhouse--Vi, who had passed me in the streets without seeing me, Vi from\\nwhom I had hidden myself, Vi who at this time yesterday morning had\\nseemed so utterly unattainable. The sense of her nearness filled me with\\nwild enthusiasm. I hummed and whistled while I dressed. I wondered\\nhow long she would make me wait before we were married. She was mine\\nalready. Why should we wait? I was impatient to go to her, I could\\nfeel the close embrace of her long white arm about my neck. I was quite\\nincurious as to who she was or where she came from. Life for me began\\nwhen I met her.\\n\\nAs I passed her door I halted, listening. I could hear my grandmother\\ntalking inside, but in such a low voice that I could catch nothing of\\nwhat was said. She was bustling about, beating up the pillows and, as I\\njudged, making Vi tidy. Hearing her coming towards the door, I hurried\\ndown the stairs. The stairs entered into the keeping-room. When she came\\ndown, she carried an empty breakfast-tray in her hand. I noticed that\\nshe had on her Sunday best: a black satin dress, a white lace apron\\ntrimmed with black ribbon, and her finest lace cap spangled with jet.\\n\\n“She’s been askin’ for you.”\\n\\nI jumped up from my chair.\\n\\n“But she won’t see you until you’ve breakfasted.”\\n\\nWhile I hastened through the meal, my grandmother chattered gaily. She\\nquite approved my choice of a wife and had drawn from Vi one fact, of\\nwhich I was unaware--that she was an American. She was burning\\nwith curiosity to learn more about her and was full of the most rosy\\nconjectures. She was quite sure that Vi was an heiress--all American\\nwomen who traveled alone were.\\n\\nShe went up to see that all was ready; then she came to the top of the\\nstairs and beckoned.\\n\\n“I’m goin’ to leave you alone,” she whispered, taking my face between\\nher hands. “God bless you, my boy.” Then she vanished all a-blush and\\na-tremble into the keeping-room.\\n\\nThe blood was surging in my brain. I felt weak from too much happiness.\\nOpening the door slowly, I entered.\\n\\nI scarcely dared look up at first. The room swam before me. The\\nold-fashioned green and red flowers in the carpet ran together. I raised\\nmy eyes to the large four-poster mahogany bed--it seemed too large to\\nhold such a little person. I could see the outline of her figure, but\\nthe heavy crimson curtains, hanging from the tester, hid her face from\\nme.\\n\\n“Vi, darling!”\\n\\nShe sat up, with her hands pressed against her throat. The sunlight,\\nshining in at the window, poured down upon her, burnishing her two long\\nplaited ropes of hair. She turned towards me; her eyes were misty, her\\nbosom swelling. She seemed to be calling me to her, and yet pushing me\\nback. I felt my knees breaking under me, and the sob beginning in my\\nthroat. I ran towards her and knelt down at the bedside, placing my arms\\nabout her and drawing her to me. For an instant she resisted, then her\\nbody relaxed. I looked up at her, pouring out broken sentences. I felt\\nthat the tears were coming through excess of gladness and bowed my head.\\n\\nShe was bending over me, so near she stooped that her breath was in\\nmy hair. The sweet warmth of her was all about me. Her lips touched\\nmy forehead. I held her more closely, but I would not meet her eyes.\\nI dared not till my question was answered. The silence between us\\nstretched into an eternity. Her hands wandered over me caressingly;\\nit seemed a child comforting a man. “Poor boy,” she whispered over and\\nover, “God knows, neither of us meant it.”\\n\\nWhen I lifted my face to hers, the tenderness in her expression was\\nwiped out by a look of wild despair. She tore my hands from about her\\nbody and tumbled her head back into the pillows with her face turned\\nfrom me, shaken by a storm of sobbing. Muttered exclamations rose to\\nher lips--things and names were mentioned which I only half heard, the\\npurport of which I could not understand. I tried to gather her to me,\\nbut she broke away from me. “Oh, you mustn’t,” she sobbed, “you mustn’t\\ntouch me.”\\n\\nWith her loss of self-control my strength returned. I sat beside her\\non the bed, stroking her hand and trying to console her--trying to tell\\nmyself that this was quite natural and that everything was well.\\n\\nGradually she exhausted herself and lay still. “You ought to go,” she\\nwhispered; but when I rose to steal away, her hand clutched mine and\\ndrew me back. In a slow, weary voice she began to speak to me. “I\\ncan’t do what you ask me; I’m already married. I thought you would have\\nguessed from Dorrie.”\\n\\nShe paused to see what I would say or do. When I said nothing, but\\nclasped her hand more firmly, she turned her face towards me, gazing up\\nat me from the pillow. “I thought you would have left me after that,”\\n she said. “It’s all my fault; I saw how things were going.”\\n\\n“Dearest, you did your best.”\\n\\n“Yes, I did my best and hurt you. When I told you that I was done\\nyesterday, why didn’t you let me go? It would all have been so much\\neasier.”\\n\\n“Because I wanted you,” I said, “and still want you.” The silence was\\nso deep that I could hear the rustle of the sheets at each intake of her\\nbreath.\\n\\n“You can’t have me.”\\n\\nHer voice was so small that it only just came to me. “I belong to\\nDorrie’s father. He’s a good man and he trusts me, though he knows I\\ndon’t love him.”\\n\\nShe sat up, letting go my hand. I propped the pillows under her. She\\nsigned to me to seat myself further away from her.\\n\\n“She is mine. She is mine,” I kept thinking to myself. “We belong to one\\nanother whatever she says.”\\n\\n“I shall be better soon,” she said; “then I can go away. You must try to\\nforget that you ever knew me.”\\n\\n“I can never forget. I shall wait for you.” Then the old treacherous\\nargument came to me, though it was sincerely spoken. “Why need we go out\\nof one another’s lives? Vi dearest, can’t we be friends?”\\n\\nShe hesitated. “I was thinking of _you_ when I said it. For me it would\\nbe easier; I have Dorrie to live for. It would be more difficult for\\nyou--you are a man.”\\n\\n“Can’t you trust me, Vi? You told me that he trusted you just now.”\\n\\nHer voice was thin and tired. “Could we ever be only friends?”\\n\\n“We must try--we can pretend.”\\n\\n“But such trials all have one ending.”\\n\\n“Ours won’t.”\\n\\nHer will was broken and her desire urged it. She held out her hand.\\n“Then let’s be friends.”\\n\\nI took it in mine and kissed it. Even then, I believe, we doubted our\\nstrength.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V--LUCK TURNS IN MY FAVOR\\n\\nThe _Ransby Chronicle_ had a full account of the averted bathing\\nfatality. In a small world of town gossip it was a sensation almost\\nas important as a local murder. Columns were filled up with what Vi’s\\nlandlady said, and Joe Tuttle, and Mrs. Cardover, and even Dorrie. They\\ntried to interview me without success; they couldn’t interview Vi, for\\nshe was in bed. From the landlady they gleaned some facts of which I\\nwas ignorant. Vi was Mrs. Violet Carpenter, of Sheba, Massachusetts.\\nHer husband was the owner of large New England cotton factories. She\\nhad been away from America upwards of a year, traveling in Europe. She\\nexpected to return home in a month. The history of my parentage was duly\\nrecorded, including an account of my father’s elopement. All the old\\nscandal concerning my mother was raked up and re-garnished.\\n\\nKnowing what my intentions had been toward Vi, my grandmother was\\nterribly flustered at the discovery that Vi was a married woman. She\\nwas hurt in her pride; she wanted to blame somebody. Her sense of the\\nproprieties was offended, and she felt that her reputation was secretly\\ntarnished. An immoral situation was existing under her roof--at least,\\nthat was what she felt. She wanted to get rid of Vi directly, but the\\ndoctor forbade her to be moved.\\n\\n“And to think I should ’ave come to this!” she kept exclaiming, “after\\nlivin’ all these years honored and respected in my little town! Mind,\\nI don’t blame you, and I don’t blame ’er. Poor things! You couldn’t\\n’elp it. But I can’t get over it--there was you a-proposin’ in my\\nspare bedroom to a married woman, and she a-lyin’ in bed! What would\\nfolks say if they was to ’ear about it? And in my ’ouse! And me so\\nhonored and respected!”\\n\\nHer horror seemed to center in the fact that it should have happened in\\nthe spare bedroom of all places, where all her dead had been laid out.\\n\\nShe took it for granted that Vi and I would part forever, as soon as she\\nwas well enough to travel. “By all showings, it’s ’igh time she went\\nback to ’er ’usband,” she said.\\n\\nShe suffered another shock when I undeceived her. “You’re playin’ with\\nfire, Dante; that’s what you’re doin’. Take the word of an old woman\\nwho knows the world--friendship will drift into familiarity and, more’n\\nlikely, familiarity ’ll drift into something else. A Cardover’s bad\\nenough where wimmen is concerned, but an Evrard’s the devil. It’s the\\ngipsy blood that makes ’em mad.”\\n\\nI turned a deaf ear to all her protests. Vi and I had done nothing\\nwicked, and we weren’t going to run away from one another as though\\nwe had. A mistake had occurred which concerned only ourselves; we had\\nnothing to be ashamed of. Then my grandmother threatened to send for\\nRuthita so that, at least, we might not be alone together. I was quick\\nto see that Ruthita’s presence would be a protection, so agreed that\\nshe should be invited down to Ransby provided she was told nothing.\\nMeanwhile no meetings between Vi and myself were allowed. My grandmother\\nguarded the spare bedroom like a dragon.\\n\\nBut in a timid way, in her heart of hearts, she was proud of the\\ncomplication. It intrigued her. It made us all interesting persons. She\\nwore the indignant face of a Mother Grundy because she knew that society\\nwould expect it of her; in many little sympathetic ways she revealed\\nher truer self. She would take her knitting up to Vi’s bedside--Mrs.\\nCarpenter as she insisted on calling her--and would spend long hours\\nthere. When conversing with me in the keeping-room late at night, she\\nwould grow reminiscent and tell brave stories of the rewards which\\ncame at length to thwarted lovers. I learnt from her that Mr. Randall\\nCarpenter was much older than either Vi or myself. If he were to\\ndie----!\\n\\nOn the second morning that Vi had been in the house I returned from\\na desultory walk to find my grandmother in close conference with a\\nstranger. He was a dapper, perky little man, white-haired, bald-headed,\\nwhiskered, with darting birdlike manners and a dignified air of\\nprecision about him. He had the well-dressed appearance of a city\\ngentleman rather than of a Ransbyite. He wore a frock-coat, top-hat,\\ngray trousers, shiny boots, and white spats. I judged that he belonged\\nto a profession.\\n\\nApologizing for my intrusion, I crossed the keeping-room, and was on the\\npoint of mounting the stairs when the little man rose, all smiles.\\n\\n“Your grandson, Mrs. Cardover, I presume? He’s more of an Evrard than a\\nCardover--all except his mouth.”\\n\\nHe was introduced to me as Mr. Seagirt, the lawyer.\\n\\n“Happy to know you, Mr. Cardover. Happy to know you, sir.” He pulled\\noff his gloves and shook hands in a gravely formal manner. “We shall see\\nmore of one another as time goes on. I hope it most sincerely. In fact,\\nI may say, from the way things are going, there is little doubt of it.”\\n\\nWe all sat down. There was a strange constrained atmosphere of\\nexcitement and embarrassment about both Mr. Seagirt and my grandmother.\\nThey balanced on the edge of their chairs, flickering their eyelids\\nand twiddling their thumbs. Lawyer Seagirt kept up a hurried flow of\\nprocrastinating conversation, continually limiting or overemphasizing\\nhis statements.\\n\\n“I have heard of what you did a day or two ago, Mr. Cardover--we\\nhave all heard of it. You have created an excellent impression--most\\nexcellent. The papers have been very flattering, but not more so than\\nyou deserve. Ransby feels quite proud of you. Though you are a Londoner,\\nyou belong to Ransby--no getting away from that. I suppose you’d tell\\nus that you belong to Oxford. Ah, well, it’s natural--but we claim you\\nfirst.”\\n\\nAll the time he had been talking he and my grandmother had been\\nsignaling to one another with their eyes, as though one were saying,\\n“You tell him,” and the other, “No, you tell him.”\\n\\nWhen they did make up their minds to take me into their secret, they did\\nit both together.\\n\\n“Your grandfather--Sir Charles Evrard,” they began, and there they\\nstuck.\\n\\nAt last it came out that my grandfather had expressed a wish to see me,\\nand had sent Lawyer Seagirt to make the necessary inquiries about me.\\nThis action on his part could have but one meaning.\\n\\nTwo days later I was invited over to Woadley Hall to spend a week there.\\nBefore I went, I had an interview with Vi, in my grandmother’s presence.\\nShe promised me that she would not leave Ransby until after I returned.\\nMy fear had been that some spasm of caution might make her seize this\\nopportunity to return to America.\\n\\nI drove out to Woadley Hall late in the afternoon, planning to get there\\nin time for dinner. I felt considerably nervous. I had been brought up\\nin dread of Sir Charles since childhood. I did not know what kind of\\nconduct was expected from me or what kind of reception I might expect.\\n\\nAs we swung in through the iron gates and passed up the long avenue\\nof chestnuts and elms which led through the parkland to the house, my\\nnervousness increased into childish consternation. The pride of ancestry\\nand the comfortable signs of wealth filled me with distress. I belonged\\nto this, and was on my way to be examined to see whether I could prove\\nworthy. I was not ashamed of my father’s family, but I was prepared to\\nbe angry if anyone else should show shame of them.\\n\\nFar away, on the edge of the green grassland, just where the woods began\\nto cast their shadow, I could see dappled fallow-deer grazing. Colts,\\nhearing us approaching, lifted up their heads and stared, then whisking\\ntheir tails galloped off to watch us from behind their dams. Turrets and\\nbroken gables of the old Jacobean Hall rose out of the trees before\\nus. Rooks were coming home to their nests in the tall elms, cawing.\\nThe home-farm lay over to our left; the herd was coming out from the\\nmilking, jingling their bells. A streak of orange lay across the blue of\\nthe west--the beginning of the sunset.\\n\\nImmediately on my arrival, I was shown to my bedroom to dress. I began\\nto have the sense of “belonging.” The windows looked out on a sunken\\ngarden, all ablaze with stocks, snap-dragon, sweet-william, and all\\nmanner of old-world flowers. In the scented stillness I could hear\\nthe splash of a fountain playing in the center. Beyond that were other\\ngardens, Dutch and Italian, divided by red walls and terraces. Beyond\\nthem all, through the shadowed trees one caught glimpses of a lake,\\nwith swans and gaily-painted water-fowl sailing like toy-yachts upon its\\nsurface.\\n\\nWhen the servant had left me, I commenced to dress leisurely. After that\\nI sat down, waiting for the gong to sound. I wondered if this was the\\nroom where my mother had slept. How much my father’s love must have\\nmeant to her that she should have sacrificed so much prosperous\\ncertainty to share his insecure fortunes. Yet, as I looked back, it was\\na smiling face that I remembered, with no marks of misgiving or regret\\nupon it.\\n\\nI did not meet my grandfather until the meal was about to be served. I\\nthink he had planned our first encounter carefully, so that our conduct\\nmight be restrained by the presence of servants. His greeting was that\\nof any host to any guest. Our conversation at dinner was on impersonal,\\nintellectual topics--the kind that is carried on between well-bred\\npersons who are thrown together for the moment and are compelled to be\\npolite to one another. The only way in which he betrayed nervousness was\\nby crumbling his bread with his left hand while he was conversing.\\n\\nFinding that I was not anxious to force matters, he became more at his\\nease. He addressed me as Mr. Cardover, with stiff and kindly courtesy.\\nWe took our cigars out on to the terrace to watch the last of the\\nsunset. He was talking of Oxford, and the changes which had taken place\\nin the University since he was an undergraduate.\\n\\n“I believe you are a Fellow of Lazarus, Mr. Cardover?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I had a nephew there a few years ago, Lord Halloway, the son of my poor\\nbrother-in-law, the Earl of Lovegrove. You may know him.”\\n\\n“Only by hearsay. He was before my time.”\\n\\nMy grandfather knocked the ash from his cigar. Then, speaking in a low\\nvoice, very deliberately, “I’m afraid you have heard nothing good about\\nhim. He has not turned out well.”\\n\\nHe paused: I felt that I was being tested. When I kept silent, he\\ncontinued, “I have no son. He was to have followed me.”\\n\\nShortly afterwards he excused himself, saying that he was an old man and\\nretired early to bed.\\n\\nFor six days we maintained our polite and measured interchange of\\ncourtesies. I was left free most of the time to entertain myself. He\\nwas a perfect host, and knew exactly how far to share my company\\nwithout appearing niggardly of his companionship or, on the other hand,\\nintruding it on me to such an extent that we wore out our common fund of\\ninterests. For myself, I wished that I might see more of him. Never by\\nany direct statement did he own that there was any relationship between\\nus. Yet gradually he began to imply his intention in having me to visit\\nhim.\\n\\nI would have been completely happy, had it not been that Vi was absent.\\nI reckoned up the hours until I should return. All day my imagination\\nwas following her movements. I refused to look ahead to the certainty of\\napproaching separation--it was enough for me that I could be near her\\nin the present.\\n\\nIt was strange how poignant the world had become, how subtly,\\nswiftly suggestive, since I had discovered her presence in it. All my\\nsensations, even those outwardly unrelated to her, grouped themselves\\ninto a memory of her sweetness. It was a blind and pagan love she had\\naroused--one which recognized no standards, but craved only fulfilment.\\n\\nThere were times when I stood back appalled, as a man who comes suddenly\\nto the edge of a precipice, when I realized where this love was leading.\\nThen my awakened conscience would remind me of my promise--that we would\\nbe only friends.\\n\\nThese were the thoughts which now made me glad, now sorrowful, as I\\nrode through the leafy lanes round Woadley at the side of my proud old\\ngrandfather. I would steal guilty glances at him, marveling that no\\nrumor of what I was thinking had come to him by some secret process of\\ntelepathy. He looked so cold and unimpassioned, I wondered if he had\\never loved a woman.\\n\\nI began to love the Woadley country with the love which only comes from\\nownership. The white Jacobean Hall, with the chestnuts and elm-trees\\ngrouped about it and the doves fluttering above its gables, became the\\nstarting point for all the future chapters of my romance. I began to see\\nlife in its prosperous, substantial aspect. The stately dignity of my\\nenvironment had its subconscious effect upon my lawless turbulence. In\\nthe morning I would wake with the rooks cawing and, going to the window,\\nwould look out on the sunken garden, the peaches ripening against the\\nwalls, the dew sparkling on the trim box-hedges, and the leaves beating\\nthe air like wings of anchored butterflies as the wind from the sea\\nstirred them. Everywhere the discipline of history was apparent--the\\naccumulated, ordered effort of generations of men and women dead and\\ngone. I had been accustomed to regard myself as an isolated unit,\\nresponsible to myself alone for my actions.\\n\\nThe last evening on entering my bedroom, I noticed that there had been\\na change in the ornaments on my dressing-table. A gold-framed miniature\\nhad been placed in the middle of the table, face up, before the mirror.\\nIt was a delicate, costly piece of work done on ivory. I held it to the\\nlight to examine it, wondering how it had come there.\\n\\nIt must have been taken in the heyday of my mother’s girlhood, when all\\nthe county bachelors were courting her. The gray eyes looked out on me\\nwith bewitching frankness. The red lips were parted as if on the point\\nof widening into laughter. The long white neck held the head poised\\nat an angle half-arch, half-haughty. As I gazed on it, I saw that\\nthe similarity between our features was extraordinary. It was my\\ngrandfather’s way of expressing to me the tenderness that he could not\\nbring himself to utter. .\\n\\nAfter breakfast next morning, he led the way into the library. He looked\\ngraver and more unapproachable than ever. “Mr. Cardover, your visit has\\nbeen a great pleasure to me. Mr. Seagirt will be here before you leave.\\nBefore he comes I wish to say that I want no thanks for what I am doing.\\nIt is more or less a business matter. All your life there have\\nbeen strained relations between myself and your father, which it is\\nimpossible for any of us to overlook or forget. So far as you are\\nconcerned, you owe him your loyalty. I do not propose to bring about\\nunhappiness between a father and a son by encouraging your friendship\\nfurther. This week was a necessary exception; I could not take the step\\nI have now decided on without knowing something about you.”\\n\\nHe cleared his throat and rose from his chair, as if afraid that I might\\nlay hold of him. He walked up and down the library, with his head bowed\\nand his right hand held palm out towards me in a gesture that asked for\\nsilence. He halted by the big French window, on the blind before which\\nyears ago I had watched his shadow fall. He stood with his back towards\\nme, looking down the avenue. Then he turned again to me. The momentary\\nemotion which had interrupted him had vanished. His voice was more cold\\nand polite than ever. Only the twitching of the muscles about his eyes\\nbetrayed the storm of feeling that stirred him.\\n\\n“In any case,” he said, “you would have inherited my baronetcy. Perhaps,\\nyou did not know that. I could not alienate that from you. The patent\\nunder which it is held allows it to pass, for one generation, through\\nthe female line to the next male holder. Until recently my will was\\nmade in the favor of my nephew, Lord Halloway. Circumstances have arisen\\nwhich lead me to believe that such a disposal of my estate would be\\nunwise. We Evrards have had our share of frailties, but we have always\\nbeen noted as clean men. Something that I saw about you in the papers\\nbrought your name before my notice. I made up my mind then and there\\nthat, if you proved all that I hoped for, I would make you my successor.\\nAs I have said, this is a business transaction, in return for which I\\nneither expect nor wish any display of gratitude.”\\n\\nWhile we had been speaking I had heard the trot of a horse approaching.\\nJust as he finished Mr. Seagirt entered.\\n\\n“Mr. Seagirt,” said Sir Charles, “I have explained the situation to\\nMr. Cardover. Any communications he or I have to make to one another\\nrelative to the estate, we will make through you. If you have brought\\nthe will, I will sign it.”\\n\\nHe was fingering his pen, when I startled him by speaking. “Sir Charles,\\nyou have spoken of not encouraging my friendship. I am a grown man and\\nof an age to choose my own friendships where I like, and this without\\noffense to my father. I have another loyalty, to my dead mother--a\\nloyalty which you share. If you care to trust me, I should like to be\\nyour friend.”\\n\\nHe took my hand in his and for one small moment let his left hand rest\\nlightly on my shoulder. We gazed frankly into one another’s eyes without\\npretense or disguise. Then the shame of revealing his true feelings\\nreturned.\\n\\n“We shall see. We shall see,” he muttered hastily; “I am an old man.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI--MOTHS\\n\\nA week had worked wonders with Grandmother Cardover. She had fallen a\\nvictim to Vi’s charm and, in that strange way that old folks have, had\\nwarmed her age at the fire of Vi’s youth. There was an unmistakable\\nchange in her; the somberness of her dress was lightened here and there\\nwith a dash of  ribbons. As long as I could remember, the only\\nornaments she had permitted herself were of black jet, as befitted her\\nwidowed state. But now the woman’s instinct for self-decoration had\\ncome to life. Vi’s exquisite femininity had made her remember that she\\nherself was a woman. She had rummaged through her jewelry and found\\na large gold-set cameo brooch, which she wore at her throat, and some\\nrings, and a long gold chain, which she now wore about her neck, from\\nwhich her watch was suspended.\\n\\nVi’s vivid physical beauty and intense joy in life had broadened the\\nhorizons of everyone in the house, and set them dreaming. Ruthita,\\ncoming down from London, had at once become infatuated. From day to day\\nshe had prolonged Vi’s visit, now with one excuse, now another. They had\\nbrought Dorrie down to stay with Vi at the shop--little Bee’s Knee as\\nmy Grannie called her, because she was so tiny and a bee’s knee was the\\nsmallest thing she could think of with which to compare her. It was many\\nyears since a child’s prattle had been heard about that quiet house.\\nVi’s comradeship with her little daughter finished the persuading of my\\ngrandmother that she was safe and good. All virtuous women believe in\\nthe virtue of a woman who is fond of children.\\n\\nThey were sitting down to lunch in the keeping-room when I entered.\\n\\n“Why, if it isn’t Dante!”\\n\\nThe greeting I received was in welcome contrast to the cold, guarded\\nreserve of the past seven days. A place was made for me at table between\\nmy grandmother and Ruthita. It was a gay little party that waited,\\nwatching me curiously across the dishes and plates, to hear my news.\\nJust then I preferred the cosiness of my grandmother’s shop to the\\nchilly dignity of Woadley Hall. Outside the sunshine slanted across the\\ncourtyard, leaving one half in shadow, the other golden white. The maid,\\ncoming in and out from the kitchen in her rustling print-dress, with her\\nsmiling country face, was a pleasanter sight than the butler at Woadley.\\nFrom the shop came the smell of tar and rope and new-made bread.\\nEverything was so frank and kindly, and unashamed of itself. Here in\\nthe keeping-room of the ship-chandler’s shop we were humanly\\nintimate--“coxy-loxy” as my grandmother would have expressed it.\\n\\nI told a sorrowful tale at first, which seemed to foreshadow a sorrowful\\nending. I spoke of the stiff formality of my reception, the garnished\\ngentility which had marked my intercourse with Sir Charles, the withheld\\nconfidence--the fact that my mother’s name was scarcely mentioned.\\nRuthita’s hand sought mine beneath the table; I could feel the fingers\\ntremble.\\n\\n“This morning,” I said, “he called me into his study. He told me that I\\nmust leave within the hour and that our friendship could go no further.”\\n\\n“The old rascal!” exclaimed Grandmother Cardover, bringing down her\\nknife and fork on her plate with a clatter. “What was he a-doin’,\\ngettin’ you there to Woadley? He must ’a’ known what we all expected.”\\n\\nI tilted back my chair, putting on an expression of long-suffering\\nmelancholy. “He wanted to see what I was like, I suppose. His chief\\nreason was that he wanted to make a new will.”\\n\\nBabel broke loose. Why hadn’t I told them earlier? Why had I harrowed\\nup their feelings for nothing? What were the particulars? I was cruel to\\nhave kept them in suspense.\\n\\nGrandmother Cardover was hysterical with joy. She wanted to run out into\\nthe streets and tell everybody. She began with the maid in the kitchen,\\nand would have gone on to the men in the bake-house if I hadn’t stopped\\nher by appealing to her curiosity, saying there was more to tell. As\\nfor Ruthita, she just put her arms about me and laid her head on\\nmy shoulder, crying for sheer gladness. Little Bee’s Knee looked on\\nopen-mouthed, shocked that grownups should behave so foolishly. Vi gazed\\nat me with a far-away stare in her eyes, picturing the might-have-beens,\\nand I gazed back at her across the gulf that widened between us.\\n\\nDiscretion was thrown to the wind. When Vi gathered Dorrie to her and\\nbegan to excuse herself, she was told that she must stay and make one of\\nthe family. Then the story was told again with the new perspective.\\n\\nWith shame and self-reproach I look back and perceive how carelessly I\\naccepted all Ruthita’s admiration. My new good fortune promised nothing\\nfor her; yet she could rejoice in it. In her shy girl’s world, had I\\nknown it, I figured as something between a faery-prince and a hero.\\nThrough me she looked out into a more generous world of glamour than\\nany she had personally experienced. Poor little Ruthita, with her\\nmouse-like timidity! She had lived all her days in a walled-in garden,\\ntreading the dull monotonous round of self-sacrificing duties. No one\\never credited her with a career of her own. No one stopped to think that\\nshe might have dreams and a will of her own. They told her what to do\\nand let their gratitude be taken for granted. She humored my father when\\nhe was discouraged, did the housekeeping, and took shelter behind the\\nsuperior social grace of the Snow Lady. We all loved her, but we made\\nthe mistake of not telling her--we supposed she knew. All the strong\\nthings that men and women do together, all love’s comedy and tragedy,\\nwere so much hearsay to her.\\n\\nThat afternoon and evening she sat beside me holding my hand with frank\\naffection, making me feel that in loving Vi I was stealing something\\nthat belonged to her. More than that, I was feeling for this woman,\\nwho had been nothing to me a few weeks ago, a quality of kindness and\\nconsideration that I had always withheld from the child-friend who had\\ntiptoed her way up to womanhood beside me.\\n\\nAfter tea we mounted to the drawing-room, which was over the shop\\nand faced the street. It was usually occupied only on Sundays and\\nfeast-days, or when a visiting Methodist minister had been apportioned\\nto my grandmother for entertainment. Faded engravings of sacred subjects\\nand simpering females elaborately framed, hung upon the walls. On the\\nmantelshelf stood some quaint specimens of Ransby china--red-roofed\\ncottages with grapes ripening above the porch, and a lover coming up\\nthe path while his lady watched him from the window. The chairs were\\nupholstered in woolwork on canvas, which my grandmother had done in\\nher youth. In one corner stood a heavy rosewood piano on which all the\\nfamily portraits were arranged. In this room comfort was sacrificed to\\nappearance--the furniture was sedate rather than genial. Nothing was\\nhaphazard or awry. The mats and antimacassars never budged an inch from\\ntheir places. No smell of beer, or cheese, or baking bread vulgarized\\nthe sacred respectability of its atmosphere.\\n\\nHere, as we sat together talking, the light began to fade. Heavy\\nfootsteps of sailors in their sea-boots, passing down the street from\\nthe harbor to the cottages, only emphasized the quiet. We watched the\\nsky grow pink behind the masts of shipping, then green, then gray.\\nCordage and rigging were etched distinctly against the gloom of the\\noncoming night. At the top of the street a light sprang up, then\\nanother, then another. The lamp-lighter with his long pole and ladder\\npassed by. Now with the heavy tread of men’s feet the tip-a-tap of\\ngirls’ footsteps began to mingle. Sometimes a snatch of laughter would\\nreach us; then, as if afraid of the sound it made, it died abruptly\\naway. While we talked in subdued voices, it seemed to me that all the\\nsailor-lovers with their lassies had conspired to steal by the house\\nthat night. I fell to wondering what it felt like to slip your arm about\\nthe waist of a woman you loved, feel her warmth and trust and nearness,\\nfeel her head droop back against your shoulder, see her face flash up\\nin the starlight and know that, while your lips were trembling against\\nhers, she was abandoning herself soul and body to you in the summer\\ndusk.\\n\\nDorrie had crept into her mother’s lap. Her soft breathing told that she\\nwas sleeping. One small hand, with fingers crumpled, rested against her\\nmother’s throat. Someone had called to see Grandmother Cardover, so Vi,\\nRuthita, and I were left alone together. Sitting back in our chairs\\nout of reach of the street-lamp, we could not see the expression on one\\nanother’s faces.\\n\\n“I would give all the world to be you, Mrs. Carpenter,” Ruthita\\nwhispered.\\n\\n“To be me! Why? I sometimes get very tired of it.”\\n\\n“If I were you I should have Dorrie. It must be very sweet to be a\\nmother. Why is it that she always calls you Vi and never mother?”\\n\\n“She picked that up from her father. I never corrected her\\nbecause--well, because somehow I like it. It makes me seem younger.”\\n\\n“You don’t need to _seem_ young,” I interrupted.\\n\\n“How old do you think I am?”\\n\\n“About the same age as myself and Ruthita.”\\n\\nShe laughed. “That couldn’t be; Dorrie is eight.”\\n\\n“Then I give up guessing.”\\n\\n“I’m twenty-seven. I was little more than a child, you see, when I\\nmarried.”\\n\\n“Mother married early,” said Ruthita, “and my papa was only twenty at\\nthe time. She says that early marriages turn out happiest.”\\n\\nVi made no answer. The silence grew awkward. We could almost hear one\\nanother’s thoughts trying to hide. Why had she explained in that tone of\\nhalf-apology, “I was little more than a child; you see, when I married.”\\n Why didn’t she say something now? Was it because an early marriage\\nhad proved for her disastrous? Then, if it had, what moral obligation\\nseparated us? Who was this husband who could dispense with her for a\\nyear, and yet had the power to stretch out his arm across the Atlantic\\nand thrust me aside?\\n\\nShe leant forward. The light from the street-lamp kindled her face and\\nsmoldered in her hair. She had the wistful, rapt expression of a young\\ngirl, ignorant as yet of the bitter-sweet of love, who dreams of an\\nideal lover. I felt then that her soul was virgin; it had never been a\\nman’s possession. It was almost mine.\\n\\nRuthita’s remark about the happiness of early marriages was forgotten,\\nwhen Vi returned to the subject. “They may be sometimes,” she said,\\nspeaking doubtfully.\\n\\nShe caught my eye resting on her. Conscious that her qualification had\\ndivulged a secret, she hurried into an implied defense of her husband.\\n\\n“I had a letter from Mr. Carpenter this morning. He’s lonely. He says\\nhe can’t bear to be without me any longer. He wants me to return home at\\nonce. He’s not seen Dorrie for nearly a year. He’s afraid she’ll forget\\nhim entirely. If I don’t go to him, he says he’ll come and fetch me.\\nIt’s been horrid of me to stay away so long. When we left, we only\\nintended to be gone for three months. Somehow the time lengthened. I\\nwanted to see so much. He’s been too easy with me. He’s been awfully\\nkind. He always has been kind. He treats me like a spoilt child.”\\n\\nShe had been speaking so eagerly and hurriedly that she had not\\nheard the creaking of the stairs. Through the darkness I could see\\nmy grandmother standing in the doorway. Vi turned to Ruthita with a\\npretense of gaiety, “No wonder you English don’t understand us. Don’t\\nyou think that American husbands are very patient?”\\n\\n“I’m sure I do,” said Ruthita. “What makes them so different from\\nEnglish husbands?”\\n\\n“They love their wives.”\\n\\nIt was impossible to tell from the bantering tone in Vi’s voice, whether\\nshe spoke the last words in cynicism or sincerity.\\n\\nGrandmother Cardover took her literally. Her national pride was touched.\\nShe believed that an aspersion had been cast on the affection of all\\nmarried Englishmen. She advanced into the room with suspicions aroused,\\nbristling with morality. “If that’s what they call love in America,” she\\nsnorted, “then it’s glad I am that I was born in Ransby. ‘They shall be\\none flesh’--that’s what the Holy Book says about marriage. And ’ow can\\nyou be one flesh if you stay away from one another a twelvemonth at a\\ntime? Why, when my Will’am was alive, I never slept a night away from\\n’im, from the day we was married to the day he died.”\\n\\nThe darkness about her seemed to quiver with indignation. I could see\\nher gray curls bobbing, and hear the keys hanging from her waist jangle,\\nas she trembled. Ruthita cowered close to me, shocked and frightened.\\nDorrie woke and began to whimper to be taken to bed. We all waited for a\\nnatural expression of anger from Vi.\\n\\nShe set Dorrie on to her feet very gently, whispering to her mothering\\nwords, telling her not to cry. Drawing herself up, she faced into the\\ndarkness. When she spoke there was a sweet, low pleading in her voice.\\n\\n“Mrs. Cardover, you took me too seriously. I’m sorry. You misunderstood\\nme. I believe all that you have said--a wife ought to be her husband’s\\ncompanion. There have been reasons for my long absence, which I cannot\\nexplain; if I did, you might not understand them. But I want _you_\\nalways to believe well of me. I have never had such kindness from any\\nwoman as you have given me.”\\n\\nI heard my Grannie sniffle. Vi must have heard her. She left Dorrie and,\\nrunning across the room, put her arms about her. I heard them blaming\\nthemselves, and taking everything back, the way women do when they ask\\nforgiveness. I lifted Dorrie into my arms, and Ruthita and I tiptoed\\nfrom the room.\\n\\nPresently they came down to us. Grandmother Cardover was smiling\\ncomically, as though she was rather pleased at what had happened. Vi\\nsaid that she must be going. Ruthita and I volunteered to accompany her\\nback to her lodgings. So the storm in the tea-cup ended, leaving me with\\nnew materials for conjecture and reflection.\\n\\nOn the way up the High Street we chatted volubly, trying to overlay what\\nhad occurred with a new impression. We talked against time and without\\nsincerity. When we had reached the black flint house and the door had\\nshut, Ruthita snuggled close to me with a relieved little sigh. Ever\\nsince my return from Woadley she had been waiting for this moment of\\nprivacy. With a sweet sisterly air of proprietorship she slipped her arm\\nthrough mine. We turned down a score and struck out across the denes\\nto the north beach, where we could be quiet. A wet wind from the sea\\npattered about our faces, giving Ruthita an excuse to cling yet more\\nclosely.\\n\\nYou would not have called Ruthita beautiful in those days. She lacked\\nthe fire that goes with beauty. She was too humble in her self-esteem,\\ntoo self-effacing. But one who had looked closely would have discerned\\nsomething more lasting than mere physical beauty--the loveliness of\\na pure spirit looking out from her quiet eyes. She was one of those\\ndomestic saints, unaware of their own goodness, that one sometimes finds\\nin middle-class families; women who are never heard of, who live only\\nthrough their influence on their menfolk’s lives.\\n\\nHer features were small, but perfect. Her figure slight, and buoyant in\\nits carriage. Her complexion white, but ready to suffuse with color at\\nthe least sign of appreciation. Her glory was in her hair, which was\\nblack and abundant as night. From a child I had always thought that her\\nfeet and hands were most beautiful in their fragile tininess. I never\\ntold her any of these flattering observations, which would have meant\\nso much if put into words. Brothers don’t--and I was as good as her\\nbrother.\\n\\n“Don’t you think,” said Ruthita, “that there’s something awfully queer\\nabout Mrs. Carpenter’s marriage? I’ve been with her nearly a week now,\\nand I’ve never heard her mention her husband until to-night.”\\n\\n“And Dorrie doesn’t speak of him either.”\\n\\n“No, I’ve noticed that.”\\n\\nThen Ruthita surprised me. “Do you know, Dante, I think to marry the\\nwrong man must be purgatory.”\\n\\nI was amused at the note of seriousness in her voice.\\n\\n“Ruthie, to hear you speak one’d suppose you’d been in love. Have you\\never thought that you’ll have to marry some day?”\\n\\n“Of course I have.”\\n\\n“What’ll he have to be like?”\\n\\nShe held her tongue. My jauntiness had made her shy. “Come, Ruthie,” I\\nsaid, “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I hate to own that you’re grown up. I\\ndidn’t think you’d given a thought to marriage. Tell me, what’ll he have\\nto be like?”\\n\\nI halted, swinging her round so she had to look up in my face. She wore\\na hunted look of cornered perplexity.\\n\\n“I’ve never spoken of these things even to mother,” she said. “They all\\ntreat me as though I were still a child.”\\n\\nI wondered what was her trouble. The searchlight swept her. I saw the\\neagerness for confession on her trembling mouth.\\n\\nThe fire which her beauty had always lacked leapt up. I was amazed\\nat the transformation. She looked reckless. The mask of maidenly\\ntranquillity had slipped aside; I saw all the longing of her unnoticed\\nwomanhood focused for an instant in her eyes. The search-light traveled\\nout to sea again. I repeated, “What must he be like?”\\n\\nShe reached up to me, so that her lips almost touched mine. “I think he\\nmust be like you,” she whispered.\\n\\nOf all answers that was the last I had expected. I had thought myself on\\nthe brink of some great discovery--that she, too, had some secret lover.\\nI slipped my arm about her and we strolled on through the darkness\\nin silence. Ahead the harbor-lights, reflected across the water, drew\\nnearer. We climbed the beach and the sea-wall, and made our way across\\nthe denes to the town.\\n\\n“You’re all wrong,” I said. “Some day, when you do fall in love, you’ll\\nget a better standard.”\\n\\nWe entered the lamp-lit town. For the rest of the evening we did not\\nsay much. I was thinking how easy it is for two people to live always\\ntogether and yet never to understand each other. Who would have guessed\\nthat little Ruthita had this hunger to be loved?\\n\\nWhile we were seated at breakfast next morning, someone walked across\\nthe shop and tapped on the door of the keeping-room. Before any of us\\ncould spring up, Lawyer Seagirt entered.\\n\\n“Keep your seats. Keep your seats,” he said cheerily. “I’m sure you’ll\\nexcuse this early call when you hear what I’ve come about.”\\n\\nWith his back to the empty fireplace, he straddled the hearthrug, bowing\\nfirst to my grandmother, then to Ruthita. Then he settled his gaze on\\nme, with the beaming benevolence of a bachelor uncle. He cleared his\\nthroat.\\n\\n“Ahem! Ahem! Mr. Cardover, I congratulate you. After you left yesterday,\\nSir Charles spoke of you with considerable feeling. He expressed\\nsentiments concerning you which from him meant much--much more than\\nif uttered by any other man. For many years he has honored me with his\\nconfidence, yet on no occasion do I remember him to have displayed so\\nmuch emotion. Of course all this is strictly between ourselves and must\\ngo no further.”\\n\\nLike three mandarins we nodded.\\n\\n“It is my pleasant duty to have to inform you, Mr. Cardover, that Sir\\nCharles has been pleased to make you an allowance. It will be paid\\nquarterly on the first day of January, April, July, and October, and\\nwill be delivered to you through my hands.”\\n\\nAgain he halted. Grandmother Cardover, losing patience, forgot her\\nmanners. “God bless my soul,” she exclaimed, “how the man maunders! How\\nmuch?”\\n\\n“Madam,” said Lawyer Seagirt, “the amount is four hundred pounds per\\nannum.”\\n\\nThe good man had never found himself so popular. He was made to sit down\\nto table with us, despite his protests that he had breakfasted already.\\nThe money might have been coming out of his own pocket for all the\\nfuss we made of him. Every now and then the fact of my prosperity would\\nstrike Grandmother Cardover afresh. Throwing up her hands she would\\nexclaim, “Four ’undred pounds, and he’s got two ’undred already from his\\nfellowship! It’s more than I’ve ever earned in any year with all my wear\\nand tear. Just you wait till his pa ’ears about it!”\\n\\nThat morning I took Ruthita to Norwich. She was puzzled when I told her\\nto get ready to come. All the way over in the train she kept trying to\\nguess my purpose. The truth was I had contrasted her with Vi. Vi was not\\nonly exquisite in herself, but as expensively exquisite as fine clothes\\ncould make her. Ruthita, on the other hand, had the appearance of making\\nthe most genteel impression at the minimum expenditure of money. My\\nfather’s means were narrow, and she was not his daughter; therefore\\nthe Snow Lady insisted on making most of her own and Ruthita’s dresses.\\nRigid economies had been exercised; stuffs had been turned, and dyed,\\nand made over again. Now that I could afford it, I was determined to see\\nwhat fine feathers could do for this shy little sister.\\n\\nWhen the gowns came home, even Ruthita was surprised at the prettiness\\nthat filmy muslins and French laces accentuated in her.\\n\\n“My word, Ruthie, you’re a dainty little armful. You won’t have to\\nwait long for that lover now,” I told her, when she came down into the\\nkeeping-room to show herself to me.\\n\\nShe pouted and made a face at me like a child. “I don’t want lovers,”\\n she laughed. “I only want my big brother.”\\n\\nWhen she had gone upstairs my grandmother turned to me. “You can go too\\nfar with her, Dannie.” She only called me Dannie when she was saying\\nsomething serious or a little wounding. “You can go too far with her,\\nDannie. I should advise you to be careful.”\\n\\n“What are you driving at?” I asked bluntly.\\n\\n“Just this, that however you may pretend to one another, she isn’t your\\nsister and you aren’t her brother. Any day you may wake something up in\\nher that you didn’t mean to.”\\n\\n“Stuff and nonsense,” I replied. “At heart she’s only a child.”\\n\\n“All I can say is you’re going the right way to work to make her a\\nwoman,” my grandmother said shortly.\\n\\nThat afternoon I persuaded Ruthita to put on all her finery and come\\nfor a walk on the esplanade. I wanted her to lose her timidity and to\\ndiscover for herself that she was as good as anybody. I felt a boyish\\npride in walking beside her; she was my creation--I had dressed her.\\n\\nWe had passed the pier and entered the long trim walk, lined with\\nsculptured Neptunes, which runs along the seafront from Ransby to\\nPakewold, when a figure which had a morbid interest for me came in\\nsight. It was that of a buxom broad-hipped woman, handsome in her own\\nbold fashion, leading by the hand an over-dressed, half-witted child. As\\nshe drew nearer, the rouge on her face became discernible. She strolled\\nwith a swagger through the fashionable crowd, eyeing the men with sly\\neffrontery. She was known in Ransby by the nickname of “Lady Halloway.”\\n She was the bathing-machine man’s daughter, and had been the victim of\\none of my cousin’s earliest amorous adventures. It was commonly believed\\nthat he was the father of her child.\\n\\nSince the news had got abroad that I had supplanted Halloway in my\\ngrandfather’s favor, she had glowered at me, with undisguised hostility,\\nwhenever we met.\\n\\nAs we passed, Ruthita’s parasol just touched her. It was the woman’s\\nfault, for she had crowded us purposely. I raised my hat, muttering an\\napology, and was on the point of moving forward, when she wrenched the\\nparasol from Ruthita’s hand and flung it to the ground. Ruthita stared\\nat her too surprised to say a word. The woman herself, for the moment,\\nwas too infuriated to express herself. All the bitterness of a deserted\\nmistress, the pent-up resentment against years of contempt and the\\nfalse pride with which she had brazened out her shame among her\\nfellow-townsmen, came to the surface and found an excuse for utterance.\\nPeople nearest to us halted in their promenade and, gathering round,\\nbegan to form the nucleus of an audience. An audience for her oratory\\nwas what “Lady Halloway” most desired. Her lips were drawn back from her\\nteeth and her hands were clenched; anger re-created her into something\\nalmost magnificent and wholly brutal. When she spoke, she addressed\\nherself to Ruthita, but her eyes were fixed on mine in vixenish\\ndefiance. The over-dressed, top-heavy oddity at her side steadied\\nhimself by clinging to her skirts, gazing from one to the other of us\\nwith a vacant, wondering expression.\\n\\nI picked up Ruthita’s parasol and handed it back to her, whispering that\\nshe should go on. The woman heard me.\\n\\n“Yes, go on, my fine lady,” she sneered in savage sarcasm. “Go on.\\nYou’re too good ter be zeen a-talkin’ wi’ the likes o’ me. Yer know wot\\nI am. I’m a woman wot’s fallen. I ain’t too bad, ’owsomever, for\\nMr. Cardover to diddle me out o’ my property. He’s a grand man, Mr.\\nCardover, wi’ ’is high airs and proud ways. And where do ’e get\\nthem from, I ax. From old Cardover’s bake-’ouse around the corner ter be\\nsure, and from ’is mawther, wot ran orf wi’ ’is father and ’ad the\\ngood luck ter get married.”\\n\\nI interrupted her. “I’m very sorry for you,” I said, “but you’ve got\\nto stop this at once. You don’t know what you’re saying, neither does\\nanyone else. Please let us pass.”\\n\\nShe stepped in front of us with her plump arms held up in fighting\\nattitude, blocking our path.\\n\\n“Zorry for me. Zorry for me,” she laughed, still addressing Ruthita. “I\\ndoan’t want ’is zorrow. Your man’s a thief, my gal, and it’s the likes\\no’ him wot despises me--me as should be Lady Halloway if I ’ad me\\nrights, me as should be livin’ at Woadley ’All as zoon as Sir Charles\\nbe dead and gorn. ’E says ’e’s zorry for me, wi’ the lawful heir,\\nthe child ’e ’as robbed, a-standin’ in ’is sight. The imperdence\\nof ’im!”\\n\\nShe gave the idiot’s hand a vicious jerk, swinging him in front of her,\\nso that the lawful heir began to holloa. Someone who had newly joined\\nthe crowd, inquired what was up.\\n\\n“Wot’s up, you axed. This gentleman, as ’e calls ’isself, told ’is\\ngal to barge inter me. That’s wot’s up, and I won’t stand it. ’E’s\\nrobbed my kid, wot was heir, o’ wot belongs ter ’im. And ’e’s\\nrobbed my ’usband, for ’e’s as good as my ’usband in the sight o’\\nalmighty Gawd. ’E treats me like a dorg and tells ’is gal to barge\\ninter me, and ’e thinks I’ll stand it.”\\n\\nWhile she had been exploding I had tried to back away from her, but\\nshe followed. Now a policeman’s helmet showed above the heads of the\\nspectators. Just then the bathing-machine man strolled up from the beach\\nout of curiosity. Seeing his daughter the center of disturbance,\\nhe fought his way to the front and seized her by the wrists with a\\nthreatening gesture. “Yer fool, Lottie,” he panted, “when are yer goin’\\nter be done a-disgracin’ o’ me?”\\n\\nFor a moment she was cowed. But as he dragged her away to the\\nbathing-machines, she tore one hand free and shook her fist at me.\\n“’E’s comin’ down to-morrer,” she shouted. “I’ve writ and told ’ im\\nwot you’ve been a-doin’ at Woadley.”\\n\\nRuthita was trembling all over with disgust and excitement. I took her\\nback to the shop. When I was alone with my grandmother I asked her what\\nkind of a woman Lottie was.\\n\\n“As nice and kind a little girl as there was in Ransby,” she answered,\\n“until that rascal, Lord Halloway, ruined her.”\\n\\nNext day I had a chance of judging for myself the worth of Lord\\nHalloway. In the afternoon, just as I was going out, I was told that\\nhe was waiting to see me in the shop. I went to meet him prepared for\\ntrouble. I found a tall, aristocratic man of about thirty-five, filling\\nup the doorway, looking out into the street with his legs wide apart. He\\nwas swinging his cane and whistling softly. The impression one got from\\nhis back-view was that he was extremely athletic. When he turned round\\nI saw that he was magnificently proportioned, handsome, high\\ncomplexioned, and graceful to the point of affectation. When he smiled\\nand held out his hand, his manner was so winning that every prejudice\\nwas for the moment swamped. He had the instinctive art of charm.\\n\\n“Awfully sorry to have to meet you like this for the first time,” he\\nsaid. “We’re second-cousins, aren’t we? Strange how we’ve managed to\\nmiss one another, and being members of the same college and all.”\\n\\nHe had removed his hat, and was leaning against the door-jamb, with\\nhis legs crossed. I watched him narrowly while he was talking. I had\\nexpected to see a cultured degenerate--the worst type of bounder.\\nInstead of being exhausted and nervous with a spurious energy, he was\\nalmost military in his upright carriage. He had a daredevil air of\\ncareless command, which was so much a part of his breeding that it\\nwas impossible to resent it. A man would have summed up his vices and\\nvirtues leniently by saying that he was a gay dog. A good woman might\\nwell have fallen in love with him, and excused the attraction that his\\nwickedness had for her by saying that she was trying to convert him.\\nThe only sign of weakness I could detect was a light inconsequent laugh,\\nstrangely out of keeping with the virility of his height and breadth; it\\nwas like the vain and meaningless giggle of a silly woman.\\n\\nI asked him if he would not come inside. He shook his head, saying that\\nthis was not a social visit, but that he had come to apologize. Then he\\nfaced me with an openness of countenance which impressed me as manly,\\nbut which might have been due to shamelessness.\\n\\n“I want to tell you how sorry I am for the beastly row you had\\nyesterday. Lottie’s not a bad sort, but she gets fancies and they run\\naway with her. I’ve talked with her, and I can promise you it won’t\\nhappen again. She’s been writing me angry letters for the past week,\\never since you made it up with Sir Charles. I was afraid something like\\nthis would happen, so I thought I’d just run down. I wish I’d managed to\\nget here earlier.”\\n\\nHe stopped suddenly, gazing toward the keeping-room door. Ruthita came\\nout and crossed the shop. She had on one of her new dresses and was on\\nher way to tea with Vi.\\n\\nHe followed her with his eyes till she was gone. There was nothing\\ninsulting in the gallantry with which he admired her; he seemed rather\\nsurprised--that was all. For a minute he continued conversing with me in\\nan absent-minded manner, then he wished me good-by, hoping that we might\\nmeet again in Oxford. I walked out on to the pavement and watched him\\ndown the street. Then I hurriedly fetched my hat and followed.\\n\\nIt might have been accidental and I may have been over-suspicious, but\\nhis path lay in the same direction as Ruthita’s; he never walked so\\nquickly as to overtake her or so slowly as not to keep her well in\\nsight. When she entered the old flint house, he hesitated, as though\\nthe purpose of his errand was gone; then, seeing me out of the tail of\\nhis eye, he turned leisurely to the left down a score. Next day I heard\\nthat he had departed from Ransby.\\n\\nI could not rid myself for many days of the impression this incident had\\ncreated. Like a Hogarth canvas, it typified for me the ugly nemesis\\nof illicit passion in all its grotesque nakedness. There was horror\\nin connecting such a man as Halloway with such a woman as Lottie. The\\nhorror was emphasized by the child. Yet Lottie had once been “as nice\\nand kind a little girl as there was in Ransby,” until he destroyed\\nher. Doubtless at the time, their sinning had seemed sweet and\\nexcusable--much the same as the love of any lover for any lass. Only the\\nresult had proved its bitterness.\\n\\nThis thought made me go with a tightened rein. When impulse tempted\\nme to give way, the memory of that woman with her half-witted child,\\nbrazening out her shame before a crowd of pleasure-seekers on the sunlit\\nesplanade, sprang into my mind and turned me back like the flame of a\\nsword.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII--THE GARDEN OF TEMPTATION\\n\\nIt was the late afternoon of a September day. We had had tea early at\\nthe black flint house, Vi, Ruthita, Dorrie, and I. After tea a walk had\\nbeen proposed; but Dorrie had said she was “tho tired” and Ruthita had\\nvolunteered to stay with her.\\n\\nFor two months Vi and I had never allowed ourselves the chance of being\\nalone together; yet every day we had met. To her I was “Mr. Cardover”;\\nto me she was “Mrs. Carpenter.” Even my grandmother had ceased to\\nsuspect that any liking deeper than friendship existed between us. She\\nloved to have young people about her, and therefore encouraged Vi and\\nDorrie. She thought that we were perfectly safe now that we had Ruthita.\\nThrough the last two months we four had been inseparable, rambling\\nabout, lazy and contented. Our conversations had all been general, Vi\\nand I had never trusted ourselves to talk of things personal. If, when\\nwalking in the country, Ruthita and Dorrie had run on ahead to gather\\nwild flowers, we had made haste to follow them, so betraying to each\\nother the tantalizing fear we had one of another. We were vigilant in\\npostponing the crisis of our danger, but neither of us had the strength\\nto bring the danger to an end by leaving Ransby, lest our separation\\nshould be forever.\\n\\nIf our tongues were silent, there were other ways of communicating. Did\\nI take her hand to help her over a stile, it trembled. Did I lift her\\nwraps and lean over her in placing them about her shoulders, I could see\\nthe faint rise of her color. Her eyes spoke, mocked, laughed, dared, and\\npleaded, when no other eyes were watching.\\n\\nSince the one occasion that has been related, Vi had not mentioned her\\nhusband. Whether he was still urging her to return, or had extended her\\nrespite, or was on his way to fetch her, I had no means of guessing.\\nI lived in a secret delirium of exalted happiness and torturing\\nforeboding. Each day as it ended was tragic with farewell. The hour was\\ncoming when I must return to Oxford and when she must return to America.\\nSoon we should have nothing but memories. However well we might disguise\\nour motives for dawdling in Ransby, it could not be long before their\\nhollowness would be detected. Already Sir Charles had ceased to serve me\\nas an excuse; I had not seen him since my departure from Woadley.\\n\\nThe very suavity of our interchanged courtesies and unsatisfying\\npretense of frank friendship gave edge to my yearning.\\n\\nI had come at last to the breaking-point. I did not know it. I still\\ntold myself that we were both too honorable to step aside: that we\\nhad too much to lose by it; that I loved her too dearly to let her\\nbe anything to me unless she could be my wife. The casuistry of this\\nattitude was patent.\\n\\nAs my hunger increased I grew more daring. No thoughts that were not of\\nher could find room in my mind. I had lost my interest in books--they\\nwere mere reports on the thing I was enduring. Nature was only my\\nexperience made external on a lower physical plane. My imagination swept\\nme on to depths and heights which once would have terrified. I grew\\naccustomed to picturing myself as the hero of situations which I had\\nformerly studied with puzzled amazement in other men’s lives.\\n\\nThe face of Lottie, encountered daily in the gray streets of Ransby,\\nwhich had at first restrained me by reminding me of sin’s ultimate\\nugliness, ceased to warn me.\\n\\nWhen Ruthita made the suggestion that we should go for our walk alone\\ntogether, I had expected a prompt refusal from Vi. She rose from the\\ndisordered tea-table and walked over to the window, turning her back on\\nus. I could see by the poise of her head that she was gazing down the\\ngardens, across the denes to the wreck, where everything important had\\ntaken place. I could guess the memories that were in her mind.\\n\\nFrom where I sat I could see her head, framed in the window against the\\nslate- expanse of water, the curved edge of the horizon, and the\\norange-tinted sky.\\n\\nCreeping across the panes under full sail came a fleet of fishing\\nsmacks, losing themselves one by one as they advanced into the tangled\\namber of her hair. I counted them, telling myself that she would speak\\nwhen the foremost had re-appeared on the other side. Then it occurred to\\nme that she was waiting for me to urge her.\\n\\n“Mrs. Carpenter,” I said casually, “won’t you come? It’s going to be a\\njolly evening. We can go by way of St. Margaret’s Church to the Broads\\nand watch the sunset.”\\n\\nWithout moving her body, she commenced to drum with her fingers on the\\npanes.\\n\\n“That would take time,” she procrastinated. “We couldn’t get back before\\neight. Who’d put Dorrie Darling to bed?”\\n\\n“Don’t worry,” Ruthita broke in with eagerness. “I’d love to do it.\\nDorrie and I’ll take care of one another and play on the sands till\\nbedtime.”\\n\\n“Yeth, do go,” lisped Dorrie. “I want Ruthita all to mythelf.”\\n\\nThese two who had stood between us, for whose sakes we had striven to\\ndo right, were pushing wide the door that led into the freedom of\\ntemptation.\\n\\nA shiver ran through her. She turned. The battle against desire in her\\nface was ended.\\n\\n“I will come,” she said slowly.\\n\\nLeft in the room by myself while they went upstairs to dress, I did not\\nthink; I abandoned myself to sensations. I could hear their footsteps go\\nback and forth above my head. The running ones were Dorrie’s. The\\nlight, quick ones were Ruthita’s. The deliberate ones, postponing and\\nanticipating forbidden pleasures--they were Vi’s. The sound of her\\nfootsteps, so stealthy and determined, combined with the long gray sight\\nof the German Ocean, sent my mind back to Guinevere’s description of her\\nsinning, which covered all our joint emotions:\\n\\n                        “As if one should\\n\\n               Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,\\n\\n               Down to a cool sea on a summer day;\\n\\n               Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven\\n\\n               Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way\\n\\n               Until one surely reached the sea at last,\\n\\n               And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay\\n\\n               Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea, all past\\n\\n               Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips\\n\\n               Washed utterly out by the dear waves o’ercast,\\n\\n               In a lone sea, far off from any ships!”\\n\\nShe entered. She was alone. The others were not yet ready. I could\\nnot speak to her. “Come,” she whispered hoarsely. Her voice had the\\ndistressed note of hurry.\\n\\nWe hastened up the High Street like fugitives. Windows of the stern red\\nhouses were eyes. They knew all about us. They had watched my mother\\nbefore me; by experience they had become wise. At the top of the town we\\nturned to the left, going inland towards the hill on which the tower\\nof St. Margaret’s rose gray against the sky, beyond which lay the open\\ncountry. We did not walk near together, but with a foot between us. Now\\nwe slackened our pace and I observed her out of the corners of my eyes.\\nShe was dressed in white, all billowy and blowy, with a wrap of white\\nlace thrown over her shoulders, and a broad white hat from which drooped\\na blue ostrich feather. Whatever had been her intention, she looked\\nbridal. The slim <DW72> of her shoulders was unmatronly. Her long neck\\ncurved forward, giving her an attitude of listening demureness. Her mass\\nof hair and large hat scarcely permitted me to see her face.\\n\\nWe came to St. Margaret’s and passed. Was it a sense of the religious\\nrestraints that it represented, that made us hurry our footsteps? We\\nturned off into a maze of shadowy lanes. We were happier now that we\\nwere safe from observation. We could no longer fancy that we saw our\\nown embarrassment reflected as suspicion in strangers’ eyes. We drew\\ntogether. My hand brushed hers. She did not start away. I let my fingers\\nclose on it.\\n\\nThe golden glow of evening was in the tree-tops. The first breath of\\nautumn had scorched their leaves to scarlet and russet. Behind their\\nbranches long scarves of cloud hung pink and green and blood-red. Far\\naway, on either side, the yellow standing wheat rustled. Nearer,\\nwhere it had been cut, the soil showed brown beneath the close-cropped\\nstubble. Honeysuckle, climbing through the hedges, threw out its\\nfragrance. Evening birds were calling. Distantly we could hear the swish\\nof scythes and the cries of harvesters to their horses. Hidden from the\\nfield-workers, we stole between the hedges with the radiant peace of the\\nsunset-on our faces. As yet we had said nothing.\\n\\nShe drew her hand free from mine and halted. Scrambling up the bank,\\nshe pulled down a spray of black-berries. I held the branch while she\\nplucked them. We dawdled up the dusty lane, eating them from her hand.\\n\\n“Vi,” I said softly, “we have tried to be only friends. What next?”\\n\\nI was smiling. She knew that I did not hint at parting. She smiled back\\ninto my eyes; then looked away sharply. I put my arm about her and\\ndrew her to me. Without a struggle, she lifted up to me her mouth, all\\nstained with blackberries like any school-girl’s. I kissed her; a long\\ncontented sigh escaped her. “We have fought against it,” she whispered.\\n\\n“Yes, dearest, we have fought against it.”\\n\\nA rabbit popped out into the road; seeing us, it doubled and scuttled\\nback into the hedge. The smoke of a cottage drifted up in spirals. We\\napproached it, walking sedate and separate. A young mother, seated on\\nthe threshold, was suckling her child. A man, who talked to her while he\\nworked, was trimming a rose-bed. They glanced up at us with a friendly\\nunderstanding smile, as much as to say, “We were as you are now last\\nSeptember.”\\n\\nWhen a corner of the lane had hidden us, I again placed my arm about\\nher. “Tell me, what have you to lose by it?”\\n\\n“Lose by it?”\\n\\n“Yes. I know so little of your life. What is he like?”\\n\\n“My husband?”\\n\\nShe flushed as she named him. I nodded.\\n\\n“He is kind.”\\n\\n“You always say that.”\\n\\n“I say it because it is all that there is to say. He is a good man,\\nbut----”\\n\\n“And in spite of that _but_ you married him.”\\n\\n“No, I was married to him. He was over forty, and I was only eighteen\\nat the time. He was in love with me. My father was a banker; he lent my\\nfather money to tide him over a crisis. Then they told me I must marry\\nhim. I was only a child.”\\n\\n“And you never loved him? Say you never loved him!”\\n\\nShe raised her head from my shoulder and looked me in the face with her\\nfearless eyes. “I never loved him. I have been a sort of daughter to\\nhim. I scarcely knew what marriage meant until--until it was all over.\\nThen for a time I hated him; I felt myself degraded. Dorrie came. I\\nfought against her coming. Then I grew reconciled. I tried to be true to\\nhim because he was her father. He made me respect him, because he was\\nso patient. Dante, when I think of him, I become ashamed of what we are\\ndoing.”\\n\\nHer nostrils quivered, betraying her suppressed emotion. She had spoken\\nwith effort.\\n\\n“Why did you leave him? Did you intend to go back to him?”\\n\\nShe became painfully confused.\\n\\n“Why do you put so many questions?” she cried. “Don’t you trust me?”\\n\\n“Vi, I trust you so much that for you I’m going to alter all my life.\\nI’m so glad that you too are willing to be daring.”\\n\\n“Then why do you question me?”\\n\\n“Because I want to be more sure that he has no moral right to you.”\\n\\n“I left him,” she said, “because I could no longer refuse him. He was\\nbreaking down my resistance with his terrible kindness. If he had only\\nbeen unjust and had given me some excuse for anger, I could have endured\\nit. But day after day went by with its comfort, and its heartache, and\\nits outward smoothness. And day after day he was looking older and more\\npatient, and making me feel sorrier for him. He got to calling me ‘My\\nchild.’ People said how beautiful we were together. I couldn’t bear to\\nstay and watch him humbling himself and breaking his heart about me. So\\nI asked him to let me go traveling with Dorrie. He let me go, thinking\\nthat absence and a change of scene might teach me how to love him.”\\n\\nShe hid her face against me. It was burning.\\n\\n“He thinks you are coming back again?”\\n\\n“He thinks so in every letter he writes. I thought so too when I went\\naway.”\\n\\n“Vi, you never wear a wedding ring. Why is that if you meant to return\\nto him?”\\n\\n“I wanted to be young just for a little while. They made me a woman when\\nI was only a child.”\\n\\n“And that was why you taught Dorrie to call you Vi?” The pity of it got\\nme by the throat. I kissed her eyes as she leant against me. “Poor girl,\\nthen let us forget it.” She struggled feebly, making a half-hearted\\neffort to tear herself away. “But we can’t forget it,” she whispered.\\n“We can’t, however we try. There’s Dorrie. He loves her terribly. He\\nwould give me anything, except Dorrie.”\\n\\n“And we both love Dorrie,” I said; “we could never do anything that\\nwould spoil her life--that would make her ashamed of us one day. You’re\\ntrembling like a leaf, Vi. You mustn’t look afraid of me.”\\n\\nGradually she nestled closer in my embrace. It was not me that she had\\nfeared, but consequences. We became sparing in our words; words stated\\nthings too boldly.\\n\\nComing to the end of the lane, we sauntered out on to a broad white\\nroad. It wound across long flat marshes where the wind from the sea is\\nnever quiet. The marshes are intersected with dikes and ditches, dotted\\nwith windbreaks for the cattle, and bridged here and there with planks.\\nOne can see for miles. There is nothing to break the distance save\\nsquare Norman towers of embowered churches in solitary hamlets and oddly\\nbarrel-shaped windmills with sails turning, for all the world like\\nstout giants, gesticulating and pummeling the sky. Here the orchestra\\nof nature is always practising; its strings, except when a storm is\\nbrewing, are muted. From afar comes the constant bass of the sea,\\nstriking the land in deep arpeggios. Drawing nearer is the soprano\\nhumming of the wind or the staccato cry of some startled bird. Then\\ncomes a multitude of intermittent soloists,--frogs croaking, reeds\\nrustling, cattle lowing, the rumbling wheels of a wagon. They clamor\\nin subdued ecstasy, now singly and now together. Through all their song\\nruns the murmuring accompaniment of water lapping.\\n\\nIn gleaming curves across this green wilderness flow fresh-water lagoons\\nand rivers which are known as the Broads. Dotted with water-lilies,\\nbarriered with bulrushes, they reflect the sky’s vast emptiness.\\nBrimming their channels they slip over into the meadows, flashing like\\nquicksilver through ashen sedges.\\n\\nThe sun had vanished. The lip of the horizon was scarlet. The dust of\\ntwilight was drifting down. In this primitive spaciousness and freedom\\none’s thoughts expanded.\\n\\n“Vi,” I whispered, “we’re two sensible persons. Of what have we to be\\nafraid? Only ourselves.”\\n\\n“There’s the future.”\\n\\n“The future doesn’t belong to us. We have the present. All our lives\\nwe’ve wanted to be happy. Don’t let’s spoil our happiness now that we\\nhave it. Just for to-night we’ll forget you’re married. We’ll be lovers\\ntogether--as alone as if no one else was in the world.”\\n\\n“And afterwards?”\\n\\n“Afterwards I’ll wait for you. Afterwards can take care of itself.”\\n\\nThe misshapen shadow of sin which had followed and stood between us,\\nholding us at arm’s length, awkward and embarrassed, was banished. If\\nthis was sin, then wrongdoing was lovely.\\n\\nWe began to talk of how everything had happened--how, out of the great\\nnothingness of the unknown, we had been flung together. How easy it\\nwould have been for us to have lived out our lives in ignorance of one\\nanother and therefore free from this temptation. We justified ourselves\\nin the belief that our meeting had been fated. It could not have been\\navoided. We were pawns on a chess-board, manipulated by the hand of an\\nunseen player. We had tried to escape one another and had been forced\\ntogether against our wills. The outcome of the game did not come within\\nthe ruling of our decision.\\n\\nThe theory brought re-assurance. It excused us. We were not responsible.\\nThen my mind fled back to my mother. She and my father had had these\\nsame thoughts as they had wandered side by side through these same\\nfields and hedges. Why had I been brought back to the country of their\\ncourting to pass through their ordeal?\\n\\nNight was coming down, covering up landmarks. Darkness lent our actions\\nmodesty; they lost something of their sharpened meaning because we could\\nnot see ourselves acting. We lived unforgettable moments. Passing over\\nnarrow plank-bridges from meadow to meadow, we seemed to be traveling\\nout of harsh reality into a world which was dream-created.\\n\\nShe carried her hat in her hand. A soft wind played in her hair and\\nloosened it in places. Her filmy white dress was all a-flutter. Mists\\nbegan to rise from the marshlands, making us vague to one another.\\nTraveling out of the east swam the harvest moon, nearing its fullness.\\n\\n“Vi,” I whispered, taking both her hands in mine, “you don’t know\\nyourself--you’re splendid.”\\n\\nShe laughed up into my eyes with elfin daring and abandon.\\n\\n“You’re the kind of woman for whom a man would willingly die.”\\n\\n“I ought to know that,” she mocked me, “for one tried.”\\n\\n“If this were five hundred years ago, do you know what I’d do to-night?”\\n\\n“It isn’t five hundred years ago--that makes all the difference. But, if\\nit were, what would you do?”\\n\\n“I’d ride off with you.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, you wouldn’t.”\\n\\n“I should. I shouldn’t care what happened a week later. They might kill\\nme like a robber. It wouldn’t matter--a week alone with you would have\\nbeen worth it.”\\n\\n“But you wouldn’t,” she insisted; “you wouldn’t ride off with me.”\\n\\n“Shouldn’t I? And why?”\\n\\nShe freed her hands from mine and placed her arms about my neck. The\\nlaughter had gone from her face.\\n\\n“Dear Dante, you wouldn’t do it, because _you_ are _you_.” The burning\\nthoughts I had had died down. We wandered on in silence.\\n\\nAhead of us a flickering light sprang up. Out of curiosity we went\\ntowards it. We found ourselves treading a rutted field-path which led\\nback in the direction of the main road. Out of the mist grew up a clump\\nof marsh-poplars. The light became taller and redder. We saw that it was\\nthe beginning of a camp-fire. Over the flames hung a stooping figure.\\n\\n“Good-evening.”\\n\\nThe figure turned. It was that of a shriveled mummy of a\\nwoman--gray-haired, fantastic, bent, with face seamed and lined from\\nexposure. A yellow shawl covered her head and shoulders. She held a\\nburning twig in her hand, with which she was lighting her pipe.\\n\\n“Good-evening, mother. Good luck to you.”\\n\\n“Nowt o’ luck th’ day, lad,” she grumbled. “All the folks is in the\\nfields at th’ ’arvest.”\\n\\nWe seated ourselves at the blaze. She went back into the darkness. We\\nheard the snapping of branches. She returned out of the clump of poplars\\nwith a companion; each of them was carrying a bundle of dead wood for\\nfuel. Her companion was a younger woman of about thirty. She nodded to\\nus with a proud air of gipsy defiance and sat herself down on the far\\nside of the fire, holding her face away from the light of the flames.\\nThe one glimpse I had had of her had shown me that she was handsome.\\n\\n“There’s bin nowt o’ luck th’ day,” the older woman continued. “They\\nhain’t got their wage for th’ ’arvest yet and they be too cumbered wi’\\nwork for fortune-tellin’.”\\n\\n“Do you tell fortunes?” asked Vi.\\n\\n“Do I tell fortunes!” the crone repeated scornfully. “I should think I\\ndid tell fortunes. Every kind o’ folk comes ter me wot wants ter read\\nthe future. Farmers whose sheep is dyin’. Wimmem as wants childen and\\nhasn’t got ’em. Gals as is goin’ ter have childen and oughtn’t ter\\nhave ’em. Wives whose ’usbands don’t love ’em. Lovers as want ter\\nget married, but shouldn’t. Lovers as should get married, but don’t want\\nter. They all comes to their grannie. I’ve seen a lot o’ human natur’ in\\nmy day, I ’ave.”\\n\\n“And what do you tell them?” asked Vi.\\n\\n“I tell ’em wot’s preparin’ for or agen ’em. I read th’ stars and I\\nwarn ’em.”\\n\\n“Can they escape by taking your advice?”\\n\\n“That’s more’n I can say. Thar was Joe Moyer, wot was hanged at Norwich\\nfor murthering ’is sweetheart. I telt ’im ’is fortune a year ago\\ncome St. Valentine’s Day. ‘Joe,’ says I, ‘your ’and ’ll be red\\nbefore the poppies blow agen and you neck ’ll be bruk before th’ wheat\\nis ripe. Leave off a-goin’ wi’ ’er,’ says I. And the lassie a-standin’\\nthar by ’is side, she laughs at her grannie. But it all come true, wot\\nI telt ’im.”\\n\\n“Could you read the stars for me?” asked Vi.\\n\\nHer voice was so thin and eager that it pierced me like a knife. I\\nquivered with fearful anticipation. All our future might depend on what\\nthis hag by the roadside might say. I did not want to hear her. She\\nmight release terror from the ghost-chamber of conscience. However much\\nwe scoffed at her words, they would influence our actions and haunt our\\nminds. Who could say, perhaps Joe Moyer would never have murdered his\\nsweetheart and would not have been hanged at Norwich, if she hadn’t\\nsuggested his crime.\\n\\n“Vi,” I said sternly, “you don’t believe in fortune-telling. We must be\\ngoing; it’s getting late.”\\n\\n“Hee-hee-hee!” the gipsy tittered, “if she don’t believe in\\nfortune-tellin’, we knows who do. Come, don’t be afeard, me dearie.\\nCross me ’and wi siller and I’ll read the stars for ’ee.”\\n\\nVi crossed her palm with a shilling. The gipsy flung fresh twigs on the\\nfire, that she might study the lines in Vi’s hands more clearly. As\\nthe flames shot up, they illumined the other woman. Her features were\\nstrongly Romany, dark and fierce and shy. Somewhere I had seen them;\\ntheir memory was pleasant. She regarded me fixedly, as though in a\\ntrance, across the fire. She too was trying to remember. Then, rising\\nnoiselessly, she stole like a panther into the poplars away from the\\ncircle of light. From out there in the darkness I felt that her eyes\\nwere still watching.\\n\\nThe old fortune-teller had flung back her shawl from her head. Her\\ngrizzled hair broke loose about her shoulders. She was peering over Vi’s\\nhand, tracing out the lines with the stem of her foul pipe. Every now\\nand then she paused to ask a whispered question or make a whispered\\nstatement. Now she would look up at the stars, and now would pucker her\\nbrows. Her head was near to Vi’s. The flames jumped up and showed their\\nfaces clearly: the one white and pure, and crowned with gold; the other\\ncunning, mahogany-, and witch-like. The flames died down; the\\nshadows danced in again.\\n\\nI drew nearer and heard the gipsy muttering, “You was born under Venus,\\ndearie. Love’ll be the makin’ o’ yer, an’ love’ll be the ruin o’ yer.\\nYou’ll always be longin’ an’ longin’ an’ lookin’ for the face o’ ’im\\nas is comin’. You’re married, dearie, but it warn’t to the right ’un,\\nand yer’ve ’ad childen by ’un. Cross me ’and wi’ siller, dearie. Cross\\nme ’and wi’ siller. I can’t see plain. That’s better. Now I see un.\\n’E’s comin’, dearie, and ’e’ll be tall and masterfu’, yer ’ll ’ave\\nter sin ter get ’un. Aye, it’s all writ ’ere, but it gets mazed--the\\nlines rin t’gether.”\\n\\nShe dragged Vi’s hand lower to the ground, nearer the fire. She was\\nexcited and clearly puzzled. She kept on croaking out what she had said\\nalready, “Yer ’ll ’ave ter sin ter get ’un. It’s all writ ’ere.\\nAye, but it can’t be--it can’t be for sartin. It gets all mazed and\\ntangled.”\\n\\nShe turned her head, blinking across the blaze to where her companion\\nhad been sitting.\\n\\n“Lil, Lil,” she cried hoarsely, “come ’ere. I can’t see plain. Young\\neyes is better.”\\n\\nLil emerged out of the shadows, treading as softly as retribution\\nfollowing temptation. She bent over the hand, unraveling the lines to\\nwhich the fortune-teller pointed with her pipe-stem.\\n\\nLil! Lil! Where had I heard that name before? The wind rustled the\\nleaves of the poplars and caused the ash of the fire to scatter.\\n\\n“Whenever he hears your voice, it shall speak to him of me. If he goes\\nwhere you do not grow, oh, grass, then the trees shall call him back. If\\nhe goes where you do not grow, oh, trees, then the wind shall tell him.\\nHis hand shall be as ours, against the works of men. When he hears your\\nvoices, he shall turn his face from walls and come back.”\\n\\n“Do you want to know the future?” she asked, peering into Vi’s face\\ngravely.\\n\\nVi hesitated. “Is it so terrible?” she whispered.\\n\\n“Not terrible as we gipsies reckon it; but sweet and dangerous and\\nreckless, and it ends in----”\\n\\n“Lilith.”\\n\\nI caught her by the wrist. She shot upright and faced me.\\n\\n“Don’t you know me? I’m Dante--Dante Cardover.”\\n\\nVi had sunk upon her knees and stared up at us, steadying herself with\\nher hands. The old hag gazed angrily from behind Lilith, stretching out\\nher long thin neck.\\n\\n“I remember you, brother,” said Lilith. “You are one of us. I knew that\\none day you would hear us calling.”\\n\\n“Wot did ’ee see in the lady’s ’and?”\\n\\nThe fortune-teller laid a skinny claw on Lilith’s shoulder; her voice\\nquavered with eagerness.\\n\\n“I will not tell,” said Lilith.\\n\\n“Did ’ee see----?”\\n\\nLilith clapped her hand over the woman’s mouth. “You shan’t tell,\\ngrannie,” she said; “it’s not good to tell.”\\n\\nDown the field-track came the creaking sound of wheels. I looked up and\\nsaw through the poplars the swinging lanterns of a caravan.\\n\\nVi touched me on the arm. She was unnerved and trembling. “Take me home,\\nDante.”\\n\\nI turned to Lilith. “Who is that?”\\n\\n“G’liath.”\\n\\n“Where’ll you be camping to-morrow? At Woadley Ham?”\\n\\nA cloud passed over her face. “We never camp there, now.”\\n\\nThe crone broke in with a spiteful titter: “But we used ter, until she\\nwouldn’t let us.”\\n\\nLilith spoke hastily. “We’re going to Yarminster Fair. We get there\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\n“Then I’ll see you there,” I told her.\\n\\nThe caravan had come to a halt. I could see the tall form of G’liath\\nmoving about the horses. I did not want to meet him just then. Skirting\\nthe encampment, we hurried off across fields to the highroad.\\n\\nA sleepy irritable landlady opened the door to Vi. By the time I had\\nwalked down the High Street to the shop, it was nearly midnight. Ruthita\\nwas sitting up for me; my grandmother had been in bed two hours. She\\neyed me curiously. “You had a long walk,” she said.\\n\\n“Yes, longer than we expected.” I spoke brusquely. I was afraid she\\nwould question me.\\n\\nAt the top of the stairs, just as I was entering my room, she stole near\\nto me.\\n\\n“Dante, ar’n’t you going to kiss me good-night?”\\n\\nI was bending perfunctorily over her lifted face, when I saw by the\\nlight of the candle in my hand that her eyes were red.\\n\\n“Ruthie, you little goose, you’ve been crying. What’ve you been crying\\nabout?”\\n\\n“I’ve not,” she denied indignantly, and broke from me. After she had\\nentered her room I tiptoed down the passage and listened outside her\\ndoor.\\n\\nIn the stillness of the house I could hear her sobbing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII--THE WAY OF ALL FLESH\\n\\nFor good luck’s sake smile, Ruthita,” said my grandmother. “There\\nyou’ve sat all through breakfast lookin’ like a week o’ Sundays, with\\nyour face as long as a yard o’ pump water. What’s the matter with you,\\nchild? Ain’t you well?”\\n\\nI saw the brightness come into Ruthita’s eyes and the lashes tremble. I\\nknew by the signs that directly she heard her own voice she would begin\\nto cry, so I answered for her.\\n\\n“I can tell you what’s the matter. I upset her last night. It was nearly\\ntwelve when I got home from my walk with Mrs. Carpenter. Ruthie’d\\ngot herself all worked up. Thought we’d been getting drowned again or\\nsomething, didn’t you, Ruthie? It was too bad of me to keep her sitting\\nup so late.”\\n\\nA heavy silence fell. Ruthita dropped her eyes, trying to recover her\\ncomposure. My grandmother’s face masked itself in a non-committal stare.\\nShe gazed past me out of the window, and seemed to hold her breath; only\\nthe faint tinkling of the gold chain against the jet of her bodice, told\\nhow her breath came and went. She had placed her hand on the coffee-pot\\nas I began to speak. When I ended, it stayed there motionless. From the\\nbake-house across the courtyard came the bump, bang, bump of the bakers\\npounding the dough into bread.\\n\\n“So you stayed out with Mrs. Carpenter till nearly twelve?”\\n\\nMy grandmother never used dialect when she wished to be impressive. Her\\ntones were icily refined and haughty--\\n\\nI recognized them as belonging to her company manners. She could be\\ncrushingly aloof and dignified when her sense of the moralities was\\noffended. She had practised her talent for “settin’ folks down and\\nmakin’ ’em feel like three penn’orth o’ happence” to some purpose on\\ngrizzled sea-captains.\\n\\n“Yes, till nearly twelve. It was pretty late, wasn’t it? We met some\\ninteresting people camping on the marshlands--old friends of mine and\\nRuthita’s.”\\n\\n“Indeed! And you walked back from the Broads about midnight with a\\nmarried woman.”\\n\\n“Oh, no. It wasn’t much after ten when we started back. Time passed\\nquickly; we didn’t realize how late it was getting. It didn’t matter,\\nexcept for Ruthita. It was bright moonlight. The country looked\\nperfect.”\\n\\n“It must ha’ done,” said my grandmother sarcastically.\\n\\n“It did. Some day we must try it all together.”\\n\\n“And who were your interesting friends? Respectable people, no doubt, to\\nbe camping on the marshlands.”\\n\\n“They weren’t respectable. They were gipsies.” Then, turning to Ruthita,\\n“It was Lilith that we met. You remember Lilith of Epping Forest--that\\ntime we ran away to get married. Fancy meeting her after all these\\nyears! And just as I left, I saw G’liath drive up. I could swear it was\\nthe same old caravan, Ruthie.”\\n\\nCuriosity and love of romance melted my grandmother’s reserve.\\n\\n“G’liath! Why, that’s the gipsy family to which Sir Charles’s mother\\nbelonged. They must be kind o’ relatives o’ yours.”\\n\\n“I suppose they must. I never thought of that. I’ll have to ask Lilith\\nabout it. They were on their way to Yarminster Fair. We’ll run over and\\nsee them.”\\n\\nJust then the errand boy, who was minding the shop, tapped at the\\nkeeping-room door and handed in a note for me. I saw that it was\\nunstamped and addressed in a handwriting that I did not recognize.\\n\\n“Where did this come from?”\\n\\n“It war left jist nar acrost the counter by a sarvant-gal.”\\n\\n“All right.”\\n\\nRuthita was telling my grandmother all that she could remember of\\nLilith. I ripped open the envelope and read:\\n\\n_Something has happened. Must see you at once. Come as soon as you can.\\nVi._\\n\\n“Who’s your letter from?”\\n\\n“From Mrs. Carpenter.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Carpenter again! What does she want? It’s not more’n nine hours\\nsince you saw her.”\\n\\n“She wants my advice on--on a business matter.”\\n\\n“Humph! I ’ope she may profit by it.”\\n\\nAs I was sauntering out of the shop Ruthita called after me in her high\\nclear voice, “Going to take me to Yarminster to-day, Dante?”\\n\\n“Don’t know yet. I’ll tell you later.”\\n\\nUntil I reached the top of the street I strolled jauntily; I was sure\\nI was being watched. I had left an atmosphere of jealous annoyance and\\nbaffled suspicion behind. It was absurd to be nursed and guarded by\\naffectionate relatives in the way I was.\\n\\nI was puzzled by Vi’s note. I worked out all kinds of conjectures as I\\njostled my way through fisher-girls and sailors up the High Street.\\n\\nI was shown into the room at the back of the black flint house, which\\noverlooked the sea. The windows were open wide; wind fluttered the\\ncurtains. Breakfast things were only partially cleared from the table.\\nUpstairs I could hear Dorrie’s piping voice and, now and then, could\\ncatch a phrase of what she was saying.\\n\\n“Let me thee him too, Vi. Oh, pleath. No, I don’t want to play wiv\\nAnnie. I want to play wiv Dante.”\\n\\nThen I heard the thump, thump, thump of Dorrie stumping from stair to\\nstair by way of protest, and the heavy step of Annie taking her forcibly\\nto the kitchen.\\n\\nVi descended a moment later. She entered without eagerness, shutting the\\ndoor carefully behind her. There was never anything of hurry or neglect\\nin her appearance; she always looked fresh and trimly attired. The high\\ncolor in her usually pale cheeks was the only sign of perturbation.\\n\\nShe crossed the room towards me with a slow, swaying motion, and halted\\na foot away, holding out her hand. I took it in mine, pressing it\\ngently. Her mouth was quivering. She was making an effort to be formally\\npolite and was not succeeding. The soft rustling of her skirts, the\\nslow rise and fall of her bosom, her delicate fragrance and timid\\nbeauty--everything about her was bewilderingly feminine. What arguments,\\nI wondered, what campaigns of caution, what capitulations of wild\\ndesires to duty were going on behind that smooth white forehead? My grip\\non her hand tightened; I drew her to me. Her cold remoteness added to my\\nyearning.\\n\\n“What is it? Why did you send for me? You’ve changed since last night.”\\n\\nShe drew her hand free from mine. I saw that, for the first time since I\\nhad known her, she was wearing a band of gold upon her wedding-finger.\\n\\n“It’s all over, Dante.”\\n\\nShe whispered the words, wringing her hands and staring away from me out\\nto sea. I slipped my arm about her shoulder. “It can never be all over,\\ndearest.”\\n\\nFor answer she handed me a letter. It bore a United States stamp and was\\naddressed to her in a bold, emphatic, perpendicular hand which revealed\\nthe writer’s vigorous determination of character.\\n\\n“From my husband. Read it.”\\n\\nStanding a little apart from her at the window, I drew out a carefully\\nfolded letter. It was dated from Sheba, Massachusetts, nine days\\nprevious to its arrival. While I read it, I watched her stealthily, how\\nshe stood charmingly irresolute, twisting the gold-band off and on her\\nfinger.\\n\\n_My dearest Vi:_\\n\\n_I have written you many times, asking you to fix definitely the day of\\nyour return. You’ve put me off with all kinds of excuses. Latterly you\\nhave not even referred to my question. My dear child, don’t think I\\nblame you; you probably have your own reasons for what you are doing.\\nBut people are beginning to talk about us here. For your own sake you\\nought to return. We’ve always tried to play fair by one another. You\\nwere always game, Vi; and now it’s up to you._\\n\\n_I’m lonely. I want my little Dorrie. Most of all I want my wife. I\\ncan’t stand this absence much longer. On receipt of this send me a cable\\n“Coming,” followed by the date of your sailing. If I don’t receive such\\na cable within ten days of mailing this letter, I shall jump on a boat\\nand come over. I don’t distrust you, but I’m worn out with waiting.\\nCan’t you understand how I want you? Nothing in the world matters to me,\\nmy child, except you._\\n\\n_Your affectionate husband,_\\n\\n_Randall._\\n\\nI re-folded it methodically and returned it to the envelope. I tried to\\npicture this man who had sent it. He was manifestly elderly. Probably he\\nwas portly, a trifle pompous and genially paternal in his manners. What\\nvolumes his trick of calling her “my child” revealed concerning their\\nrelations. I contrasted him with Vi. Vi with her eager youth, her\\npassion to taste life’s rapture, her slim white body so alluring and\\nso gracious, her physical fineness, her possibilities for bestowing and\\nreceiving natural joy. If I let her go, she would slowly lose her\\nzest for life. She would forget that she was a woman and would sink\\nprematurely into stolid middle-age. Her possibilities of motherhood\\nwould slip from her untaken and never to be renewed. The little rascals,\\nwith golden hair and features which should perpetuate her beauty, would\\nnever be born to her. Those children should be hers and mine. _Hers and\\nmine_. How the words beat upon my brain! They were like the fists of\\nlittle children, battering against the closed doors of existence. It\\nwas monstrous that the justice of this husband’s claim to her should be\\nbased on his injustice in having married her.\\n\\nAgain I formed my mental picture of him, formed it with the cruel\\nsarcasm of youth. His body was deteriorated; his skin puckered and\\nyellow; the fine lines of suppleness and straightness gone; the muscles\\nflabby and jaded. Then I looked at her: gold and ivory, with poppies for\\na mouth. Sweet and nobly chaste. A woman to set a man on fire--to drive\\nhim to the extremes of sorrow or gladness. A woman to sin for.\\n\\nI turned from the window and took one step towards her. I could feel her\\nbody throbbing against mine. The fierce sweet ecstasy of my delight hurt\\nher. I saw nothing but her eyes. All else in the world was darkness.\\n\\n“Let me go,” she panted.\\n\\n“Do you want to go?” I whispered.\\n\\nShe sank her head on my shoulder. Her arms were about my neck. I could\\nonly see her golden hair. Her answer came to me broken and muffled. “No,\\nno, no.”\\n\\nI carried her to the sofa and knelt beside her.\\n\\n“You won’t ever despise me, will you?”\\n\\nHow absurd her question sounded.\\n\\nWithout any reference to our ultimate purpose, we set about making our\\nplans. We must get away from Ransby. We must not be seen together any\\nmore that day. We would meet at the station that evening, and travel up\\nto London together by the train leaving Ransby at six-thirty-eight. Our\\nplans went no further.\\n\\nNow that all had been arranged, a new embarrassment arose between us--a\\nsweet shamefulness. She clung to me, yet she cast down her eyes, her\\ncheeks encrimsoned, not daring to look me in the face. We touched one\\nanother shyly and shuddered at the contact. Our hearts were too full for\\nwords, our thoughts too primitively intimate to be expressed. The veils\\nhad dropped from our eyes. The mystery of mysteries lay exposed. We saw\\none another, natural in our passions--exiles from society. No artificial\\nrestraints stood between us; in our conduct with one another we were\\nfree to be governed by our own desires.\\n\\nA scurry of little feet in the passage. The sound of heavier ones\\npursuing. We sprang apart. Dorrie entered, running with her arms\\nstretched out towards me. “Catch me, Dante. Don’t let her get me.”\\n\\nThe rueful face of Annie appeared in the doorway; her plump arms covered\\nto the elbows with flour. “If ’ee please, mum,” she said, “it warn’t\\nno fault o’ mine. She nipped out afore I could get a-holt o’ her, while\\nI war a-makin’ o’ the pudden.”\\n\\n“You’re juth horwid,” cried Dorrie. “Go ’way. I want to thpeak to\\nDante.”\\n\\nShe scrambled on my knee, clutching tightly to my coat till Annie had\\nvanished. Then she tossed her curls out of her eyes, and told me all\\nthat she and Ruthita had done together on the previous evening. While\\nshe was talking, I watched Vi, trying to realize the seemingly\\nimpossible truth that she had promised herself to me, and would soon be\\nmine. A host of bewildering images rushed through my mind as I gazed\\ninto the future. I was amazed at myself that I should feel no fear of\\nthe step which we contemplated.\\n\\n“Old thtupid,” cried Dorrie in an aggrieved voice, “you weren’t\\nlithening.”\\n\\nShe smoothed her baby fingers up and down my face, coaxing me to give\\nher my attention.\\n\\n“Sorry, little lady, but I must be going. You must tell me all about it\\nsome other time.”\\n\\n“All wite,” she acquiesced contentedly; “it’s a pwomith.”\\n\\nVi accompanied me to the door.\\n\\n“To-night.”\\n\\n“To-night.”\\n\\n“What wath you thaying?” asked Dorrie.\\n\\n“Nothing, my darling.”\\n\\nMy grandmother was sitting behind her counter, knitting, when I entered.\\nShe sank her chin and looked at me humorously over her spectacles.\\n“Well, my man of business, did she take your advice?”\\n\\n“Of course. Why shouldn’t she? She’s seen my grannie, and knows how\\nshe’s profited by it.”\\n\\n“Clever boy,” she retorted. “Who made your shirt? When a man of business\\nis born among the Cardovers, pears’ll grow on pines. Look at your\\nfather. Look at the Spuffler. Look at yourself. I hope she won’t act on\\nit. What was it?”\\n\\n“Can’t tell you now. I find I’ve got to run up to London to-night and\\nI’ve promised to take Ruthie to Yarminster. There’s only just time.”\\n\\n“What’s takin’ you to London? You didn’t say anythin’ about it this\\nmarnin’.” She dropped her knitting in her lap. “Dante, is it anythin’ to\\ndo with her?”\\n\\n“Partly.”\\n\\nShe beckoned me nearer to her. I leant over the counter. She glanced\\nmeaningly towards the door of the keeping-room. I stooped lower till our\\nheads nearly touched. “You’d better stay there, laddie,” she whispered.\\n“I’ve been thinkin’ and usin’ me eyes. This ain’t no place fur you at\\npresent. She’s gettin’ too fond of you and you of her. I know.” She\\nnodded. “I’ve been through it. I watched your pa at it.”\\n\\n“At what?”\\n\\n“At what you and Mrs. Carpenter are doin’. Don’t pretend you’re a fool,\\nDante, ’cause you’re not--and neither is your old grannie.”\\n\\nJust then Ruthita looked out of the keeping-room. I was glad of the\\nexcuse to cut this dangerous conversation short. “Hurry up, Ruthie; get\\non your togs. I’m going to drive you over to Yarminster.”\\n\\nWhen she had gone, my grandmother turned to me again. “And there’s\\nanother of ’em. Lovers can’t keep their secrets to theirselves\\nnohow--they give theirselves away with every breath. Did ye see the way\\nshe flushed wi’ pleasure? She’s a tender little maid. If you made her\\nunhappy, though she’s none o’ my body, I’d never forgive ye, Dante. If\\nyou don’t intend to marry ’er, be careful.”\\n\\n“Rubbish,” I exclaimed and went out into the street to fetch round a\\ndog-cart from the livery-stables.\\n\\n“Aye, rubbish is well enough,” was my grandmother’s final retort; “but\\nbroken eggs can’t be mended. No more can broken hearts.”\\n\\nThere was just room enough on the front-seat to take the two of us. As\\nI drove down the street I saw Ruthita come out of the shop and stand\\nwaiting on the pavement. She looked modest and pretty as a sprig of\\nlavender. There was always something quaintly virginal about her, as\\nthough she had stepped out of an old English love-song. Her eyes were\\nunusually bright this morning with the pleasure of anticipation. With\\nsubtle flattery, she had put on one of the gowns I had bought her. It\\nwas her way of saying, “This day is to be mine and yours.”\\n\\n“Don’t I do you proud?” she laughed, using one of Vi’s Americanisms.\\n\\n“No, you don’t,” I said, with pretended harshness, “I can’t think where\\nyou got such a dunducketty old dress from.”\\n\\n“A man gave it me. Didn’t he show bad taste?”\\n\\n“He showed himself a perfect ass. Now, if I were to buy you a dress,\\nRuthie, which of course I shan’t----”\\n\\n“Here, get off with you, you rascals. What’re you a-doin’, blockin’ up\\nmy pavement?”\\n\\nGrandmother Cardover stood in the doorway, her hands folded beneath her\\nblack satin apron, her keys jangling. The gray cork-screw curls from\\nunder her cap were wobbling; her plump little body was shaking with\\nenjoyment. All her crossness and caution on Vi’s account were gone at\\nseeing Ruthita and myself together. We started up at a smart trot. As\\nwe turned the corner into the High Street, we looked back. She was still\\nthere, gazing after us.\\n\\nBy the road which follows the coast, Yarminster is eight miles from\\nRansby. I turned inland by a roundabout route; I wanted to pass through\\nWoadley.\\n\\nMy spirits ran high with the thought of what was to happen shortly.\\nI was in a mood to be gay. Clouds were flying high. The country lay\\nwindswept and golden in the sunshine. The air had the sharp tang of\\nautumn--the acrid fragrance which foretells the decay of foliage. A\\npleasant melancholy lurked in the reds and yellows of woods and hedges.\\nTops of trees were already growing thin of leaves where the gales had\\nharried them. Pasturing in harvested fields, flocks of sheep lent\\na touch of grayness to the landscape. Here and there overhead gulls\\nhovered, or slid down the sky on poised wings, as though brooding on the\\nsummer that was gone.\\n\\nRuthita and I spoke of Lilith, recalling childhood’s days. We\\nlaughed over our amazement at discovering that her back was no longer\\nhumpy--that her baby had left her. Then we fell to wondering whether she\\nhad ever been married and what was her story. Our conversation became\\nintimate and confessional. I had never known much of Ruthita’s secret\\nthoughts.\\n\\n“Dante,” she cried, “why did they leave us to find out everything?”\\n\\nI slowed the horse down to a walk. “I know what you mean, Ruthie.\\nThey brought us up on fables. They left us to fight with all kinds of\\nfantastic imaginings. They allowed us to infer that so many things were\\nshameful. D’you remember what a fuss they made when they found that the\\nBantam had kissed you?”\\n\\nShe nodded, casting down her eyes. “I’ve never got over it. It’s made me\\nawkward with men--self-conscious and afraid of...”\\n\\n“And yet they were kind to us, Ruthie.”\\n\\n“But they never treated us honestly,” she said sadly.\\n\\nThat same intense look, a look almost of hunger, which transformed her,\\ncame into her face--the look which the flash-light had revealed to me\\nthat night on the denes. Sudden fear of what we might say next made\\nme shake up the horse. The jolting of the wheels prevented us from\\nconversing save by raising our voices.\\n\\nWe passed a man on the road. He shouted after us.\\n\\nAt first I thought he was chaffing. He kept on shouting.\\n\\n“Why don’t you stop?” said Ruthita. “We may have dropped something.”\\n\\nWe had turned a bend. I looked back, but could not see him. I halted\\nuntil he should come up. A big-framed man in a shooting-jacket, gaiters,\\nand knickerbockers came swinging round the corner. I was surprised to\\nrecognize in him Lord Halloway.\\n\\n“Halloa,” he shouted, “you’re going in my direction. Would you mind\\ngiving me a lift as far as Woadley?”\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said. “This horse is restive. I can’t leave the reins. I\\nsuppose you can lower the back-seat without help.”\\n\\nHe drew level on the far-side from me and stood with his hand resting on\\nthe splashboard, gazing at Ruthita. “My sister,” I said shortly.\\n\\nWhile he lowered the back and drew but the seat, he explained himself.\\n“I’m going to Woadley to look after some farms my father owns round\\nthere.” What he was really saying was, “I’m not going to try to cut you\\nout with Sir Charles, so you needn’t fear me.”\\n\\nHis manner was friendly. He had gained a high color with his walking. He\\nlooked brilliantly handsome and manly, with just that touch of indolence\\nabout him that gave him his charm. Without being warned, no one would\\nhave guessed that he was a rake. In his presence even I disbelieved half\\nthe wild tales of dissipation I had heard narrated of him. Yet, when my\\ndistrust of him was almost at rest, he would arouse it with his inane,\\nhigh-pitched laugh.\\n\\nWhen he had clambered in and we had started, I began to tell him, for\\nthe sake of conversation, where we were traveling. At the mention of\\nLilith, he interrupted.\\n\\n“Lilith! Lilith! Seem to remember the name. Was she ever in these parts\\nbefore? There was a little girl named Lilith, who used to camp with\\nthe Goliaths, the gipsies, on Woadley Ham. They haven’t been there for\\nyears. I recall her distinctly. She was wild and dark. I used to watch\\nher breaking in ponies when I was a boy stopping with Sir Charles.”\\n\\n“She must be the same.”\\n\\n“You might tell her that you met me, when you see her,” he said. “She\\nwas the pluckiest little horsewoman for her age I ever saw. She could\\nride anything. I can see her now, gripping a young hunter I had with her\\nbrown bare legs, fighting his head off. It’s odd that you should have\\nmentioned her.”\\n\\nHe tailed off into his giggling girlish laugh.\\n\\nLittle by little he commenced to address his remarks exclusively to\\nRuthita. This was natural, for I could not turn round to converse with\\nhim because of attending to the horse. I observed him out of the corner\\nof my eye, and began to understand the secret of his power over women.\\nFor one thing he talked entirely to a woman, bestowing on her an\\nintensity of attention which many would consider flattering. Then again\\nhe put a woman at her ease, drawing her out and speaking of things which\\nwere within her depth. Most of the topics which he drifted into were\\npersonal. When he mentioned himself, he lowered his voice as if he were\\nconfessing. When he mentioned her, his tones became earnest.\\n\\nI was surprised to see how Ruthita, usually so reticent, lowered her\\nguard to his attack. She twisted round on her seat, that she might watch\\nhim. Her face grew merry and her eyes twinkled with fun and laughter.\\nShe was being, what she had declared she never was--natural with a man.\\n\\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw one thing which displeased me\\nimmensely. With apparent unconsciousness, Halloway’s arm was slipping\\nfarther and farther along the back of the seat against which Ruthita\\nrested. A little more, and it would have encircled her. But before that\\nwas accomplished, he stopped short, leaving nothing to complain of. He\\nwas simply steadying himself in a jolting dog-cart.\\n\\nWe entered Woadley and passed the tall gates of the Park. I had a\\nglimpse of the Hall through the trees, and the peacocks strutting where\\nthe gardens began and the meadowland left off. I smiled to myself as\\nI wondered what would happen if Sir Charles should meet Halloway and\\nmyself together. Two miles out of Woadley Ruthita and my cousin were\\nstill industriously chatting. I had my suspicions as to the urgency of\\nhis errand. Then the arm slid an inch further along the back-rail of the\\nseat. That inch made his attitude barely pardonable. I reined in.\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you were going to Woadley?”\\n\\n“Why, yes,” he laughed. “I have to get out at the next cross-road and\\nwalk. The farms are over in that direction.”\\n\\nHe swept a belt of woodland vaguely. He lied consummately. His face told\\nme nothing.\\n\\n“Well, here’s the next cross-road.”\\n\\nMy manner was churlish. He refused to acknowledge anything hostile in my\\ntones.\\n\\n“I’m awfully grateful to you,” he said; “you’ve saved me a long walk\\nand I’ve enjoyed your company immensely.” As he spoke the last words\\nhe smiled directly into the eyes of Ruthita. “I shall hope to meet Miss\\nCardover again--perhaps at Oxford.”\\n\\nI did not think it necessary to tell him that Ruthita’s surname was\\nnot Cardover but Favart. We watched him stride away, clean-limbed and\\nsplendid--a man who had sinned discreetly and bore no physical marks of\\nhis shortcomings.\\n\\nAt last Ruthita spoke. “I don’t think I like him.”\\n\\n“You didn’t let him know it.”\\n\\n“He made me forget. He made me remember I was a woman. No man’s ever\\nspoken to me as he spoke.”\\n\\n“He’s a clever fellow to make you forget the esplanade and Lottie.”\\n\\n“Now you’re angry,” she laughed, and snuggled closer.\\n\\nWe entered the old marketplace of Yarminster where the Fair was being\\nheld. Leaving our horse at _The Anchor_ to be baited, we threaded our\\nway between booths and whirligo-rounds. Presently I heard a familiar\\ncry, “Two shies a penny. Two shies a penny. Every ball ’its a\\ncocoanut. Down she goes. Walk up. Walk up. Two shies a penny.”\\n\\nDodging up and down behind the pitch, was G’liath, not much altered. The\\ngaudy woman was absent; it was Lilith who was serving out the balls to\\nthe country bumpkins.\\n\\n“Here’s Ruthita,” I said. “You remember the little girl in the Forest?”\\n\\nShe went on catching the wooden balls which G’liath returned to her.\\nTrade was busy. Between reiterating his call, she conversed with us.\\n\\n“I remember. (Two shies a penny). It doesn’t seem long ago. (Every ball\\n’its a cocoanut. Walk up). How long is it?”\\n\\n“The best part of fourteen years.”\\n\\nIt was difficult to carry on a conversation under the circumstances.\\n\\n“I wanted to ask you about last night,” I whispered. “When’ll you be\\nfree?”\\n\\n“Not until midnight.”\\n\\nI saw Ruthita listening, so I changed the subject. “By the way, we met\\nsomeone who knew you when you were a girl at Woadley. He wanted to be\\nremembered to you.”\\n\\nHer handsome face darkened. “A man?” she asked.\\n\\n“My cousin, Lord Halloway.”\\n\\nShe halted and looked round on me in proud astonishment. “Oh!” she\\ngasped, and renewed her calling.\\n\\nRuthita broke in to tell her of my good fortune. She did not pay much\\nattention at first. Then it seemed to dawn on her. “So he’s out of it,\\nand you’ll be master at Woadley Hall?”\\n\\n“Yes.” I lowered my voice. “And then you must come back to Woadley Ham.\\nYou were good to me once, Lilith.”\\n\\n“I never forget.” There was a look of the old kindness in her eyes as\\nshe said it. “When you need me, I shall come.”\\n\\nThe crowd pressed about us, curious to overhear, surprised at seeing\\ngentlefolks so chatty with a gipsy hussy. She signed to us to go. We\\ndrew off a few paces, looking on, recalling that night at Epping, when\\nwe fled from Dot-and-Carry-One and came to G’liath’s encampment.\\n\\nShortly after that the clock of St. Nicholas boomed three, and we\\ndeparted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX--THE ELOPEMENT\\n\\n\\nRuthita was anxious to accompany me to the station.\\n\\n“I don’t want you,” I told her. “Women always make a fuss over\\npartings.”\\n\\n“But not sensible women,” she protested, smiling. “Let me come. There’s\\na dear.”\\n\\n“You’ll try to kiss me. You’ll make a grab at my neck just as the\\ntrain is moving. I shall feel embarrassed. You’ll probably slip off the\\nplatform and get both your legs cut off. A nice memory to take with me\\nto London! No, thank you.”\\n\\n“But I won’t try to kiss you, and I won’t grab at your neck. I’ll\\nbe most careful about my legs. And I don’t think it’s nice of you to\\nmention them so callously, Dante.”\\n\\n“I always tell folks,” put in my grandmother, “that, if there wer’n’t no\\npartin’s, there’d be no meetin’s. It’s just come and go in this life. If\\nhe don’t want you, my dear, don’t bother ’im.”\\n\\n“But he does want me,” Ruthita persisted. “I’ve always seen him off.\\nI used to run beside the trap till I was ready to drop when Uncle Obad\\ndrove him away to the Red House. He’s only making fun.”\\n\\n“No, really, Ruthie, I’d much rather say good-by to you here in the\\nshop.”\\n\\n“If you’re going to catch the six-thirty-eight, you’ll have to run,”\\n said my grandmother.\\n\\nRuthita looked hurt. She could not understand me. She felt that\\nsomething was wrong. I picked up my bag. They hurriedly embraced and\\nfollowed me out on to the pavement to watch me down the road. I looked\\nback.\\n\\nThere they stood waving and crying after me, “Good-by. God bless you.\\nGood-by.”\\n\\nIn passing the chemist’s shop I glanced in at the clock. It was five\\nminutes faster than my watch. I turned into the High Street at something\\nbetween a trot and a walk.\\n\\nOn entering the station I saw that the London train was ready to depart.\\nThe guard had the flag in his hand and the whistle to his lips, about to\\ngive the signal. The porters were banging the doors of the carriages.\\nI had yet to buy my ticket. Rushing to the office, I pushed my money\\nthrough. “’Fraid you won’t get the six-thirty-eight,” said the clerk.\\n\\nI reached the barrier, where the collector was standing, just as the\\nguard blew his whistle.\\n\\n“Too late,” growled the collector, closing the gate in my face with all\\nthe impersonal incivility of a man whose action is supported by law.\\n\\n“There’s a lady and a little girl on board,” I panted; “they’re\\nexpecting me.”\\n\\n“Sorry,” said the man; “should ’ave got ’ere sooner.”\\n\\nJust then the train began to move and I recognized the uselessness of\\nfurther argument. As the tail of it vanished out of the station,\\nthe collector slid back the gate. Now that there was no danger of my\\ndisobeying him, he could afford to be human. “It’s h’orders, yer know,\\nsir, else I wouldn’t ha’ done it.”\\n\\nFriends who had been seeing their travelers off came laughing and\\nchatting toward the barrier. As the crowd thinned, half way down\\nthe platform I caught sight of Vi. She was standing apart, with her\\nhand-baggage scattered beside her in disorder. Dorrie was hanging to her\\nskirts, looking up into her face, asking questions. Neither of them saw\\nme.\\n\\n“Hulloa!”\\n\\nWhen I spoke to her, Vi started. Her eyes brimmed. There shone through\\nher tears a doubtful gladness. “I thought--I thought you wer’n’t coming.\\nI thought----”\\n\\n“Vi dearest! Was that likely?”\\n\\nHer fingers closed about my arm warningly as I called her dearest. She\\ncast a scared look at Dorrie. “Not before her,” she whispered.\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. The position was queer. For a man and a woman\\nin our situation there was no readymade standard of conduct. I began\\nto feel lost in the freedom we were making for ourselves. There were no\\nlandmarks. Even now we were beyond the conventional walls of right and\\nwrong which divide society from the outcast. We were running away to\\nseek our happiness--and we were taking Dorrie!\\n\\nI began to explain hurriedly how I happened to miss the train.\\n\\n“Ruthita wanted to come to the station. I lost time in dissuading her.\\nWhen I got away, I discovered that my watch was slow by five minutes.\\nAnd then to crown all, when I could have caught the train, the man at\\nthe gate...”\\n\\n“It doesn’t matter,” she said generously. “How long before the next\\ntrain starts?”\\n\\n“About half-an-hour.”\\n\\n“That’ll do nearly as well. My boxes have gone on, but I can claim them\\nin London.”\\n\\n“We don’t want to stand in this stuffy station,” I said. “Let’s go for a\\nwalk.”\\n\\nShe began to speak, and then stopped.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n\\n“Shan’t--shan’t we be recognized?”\\n\\n“Not if we go round the harbor. We shan’t be likely to meet anyone there\\nwho knows us.”\\n\\nIt was odd, this keeping up of respectable appearances to the last.\\nRuthita, Grandmother Cardover, Sir Charles, my father--all the world\\nwould know to-morrow. They would spread their hands before their faces\\nand look shocked, and peek out at us through their fingers.\\n\\n“No one ever thpeaks to me.” Dorrie was reproachfully calling our\\nattention to her presence.\\n\\n“We’ll both thpeak to you now,” I said. “Give me your hand, Dorrie.”\\n\\nLeaving our baggage with a porter, we went out of the station to the\\nharbor, which lay just across the station-yard. Vi manouvered herself to\\nthe other side of me, so that the child walked between us.\\n\\nThe heavy autumn dusk was falling. Lanterns were being run up the masts.\\nThe town shone hospitably with street-lamps. Groping their way round\\nthe pier-head came a part of the Scotch herring fleet. We could see\\nhow their prows danced and nodded by the way the light from their lamps\\nlengthened and shortened across the water. Soon the ripple against the\\npiles near to where we were standing quickened with the disturbance\\ncaused by their advance. Then we heard the creaking of ropes against\\nblocks as sails were lowered.\\n\\nLeaning against the wall of the quay we watched them, casting furtive\\nglances now and then at the illumined face of the station-clock.\\n\\nDorrie asked questions, to which we returned indifferent answers. It\\nhad begun to dawn on her that I was going up to London with them. She\\nconstrued our secretiveness to mean that our plot was for her special\\nbenefit; people only acted like that with her when they were concealing\\nsomething pleasant. Her innocent curiosity embarrassed us.\\n\\nWhy were we going to London? she asked us. We had not dared to answer\\nthat question even to one another. For my part I tried not to hear her;\\nshe roused doubts--phantoms of future consequence. I pictured the scene\\nof long ago, when Ransby was rather more than twenty years younger, and\\nanother man and woman had slipped away unnoticed, daring the world\\nfor their love’s preservation. Had they had these same thoughts--these\\nhesitations and misgivings? Or had they gone out bravely to meet their\\ndestiny, reckless in their certainty of one another?\\n\\nBehind us, as we bent above the water, rose the shuffling clamor of\\nnumberless feet. Up and down the harbor groups of fisher-girls were\\nsauntering abreast, in rows of three and four. Now and then we caught\\nphrases in broad Scotch dialect.. They had been brought down from their\\nhomes in the north, many hundreds of them, for the kippering. They\\nparaded bareheaded, with rough woolen shawls across their shoulders,\\nknitting as they walked. I was thankful for them; they distracted\\nattention from ourselves. Vi and I said nothing to one another; our\\nhearts were too full for small-talk. The child was a barrier between us.\\n\\nA man halted near us. He had a heavy box on his back, covered with\\nAmerican-cloth. He set it down and became busy. In a short time he had\\nlighted a lantern and hung it on a pole. He mounted a stool, from which\\nhe could command the crowd, raising the lamp aloft. Fisher-girls, still\\nknitting, stopped in their sauntering and gathered round him. Several\\nsmacksmen and sailors, with pipes in their mouths, and hands deep in\\npockets, loitered up.\\n\\nThe man began to talk, at first at random, like a cheap-jack, trying to\\ncatch his hearers’ attention with a laugh. Then, when his audience was\\nsufficiently interested, he unrolled a sheet upon which the words of a\\nhymn were printed. He held it before him like a bill-board, so that all\\ncould see and the light fell on it. He sang the first verse himself in\\na strong, gusty baritone. One by one the crowd caught the air and joined\\nin with him.\\n\\nThey sang four verses, each verse followed by a chorus. The man allowed\\nthe sheet to drop, and handed the pole with the lantern to a bystander.\\n\\nHis brows puckered. His eyes concentrated. His somewhat brutal jaw\\nsquared itself. His face had become impassioned and earnest all of\\na sudden. It had been coarse and rather stupid before; now a certain\\neagerness of purpose gave it sharpness. He began to talk with vehemence,\\nmaking crude, forceful gestures, thrashing the air with his arms,\\nbringing down his clenched right-fist into the open palm of his\\nleft-hand when a remark called for emphasis. His thick throat swelled\\nabove the red knotted handkerchief which took the place of a collar. He\\nspoke with a kind of savage anger. He mauled his audience with brutal\\neloquence. His way of talking was ignorant. He was displeasing, yet\\ncompelling. There were fifteen minutes until the train started. I\\nwatched him with cynicism as a diversion from my thoughts.\\n\\n“Brothers and sisters,” he shouted, “we are ’ere met in the sight of\\nh’Almighty Gawd. It was ’im as brought us together. Yer didn’t know\\nthat when yer started out this starlit h’evenin’ for yer walk. It was\\n’im as sent me ’ere ter tell yer this evenin’ that the wages o’ sin\\nis death. I know wot h’I’m a-saying of, for I was once a sinner. But\\nblessed be Gawd, ’e ’as saved me and washed me white h’in ’is\\nson’s precious blood. ’E can do that for you ter-night, an ’e sent\\nme’ere ter tell yer.”\\n\\nSome of the Cornish Methodists, in Ransby for the herring season, began\\nto warm to the orator’s enthusiasm. They urged him to further fervor by\\nejaculating texts and crying, “Amen!”\\n\\n“Blessed be ’is name!”\\n\\n“Glory!” etc.\\n\\nThe man sank his voice from the roaring monotone in which he had\\nstarted. “The wages o’ sin is death,” he repeated. “Oh, my friends, h’I\\nspeak as a dyin’ man to dyin’ men. Yer carn’t h’escape them wages nohow.\\nThe fool ’as said in ’is ’eart, ‘There ain’t no Gawd.’ ’Ave you\\nsaid that? Wot’ll yer say when yer ’ave ter take the wages? Now yer\\nsay, ‘No one’s lookin’. They’ll never find out. H’everyone’s as bad as I\\nh’am, only they doan’t let me know it. I’ll h’injoy myself. There ain’t\\nno Gawd.’ I tells yer, my friends, yer wrong. ’E’s a-watchin’ yer now,\\nlookin’ down from them blessed stars. ’E looks inter yer ’eart\\nand sees the sin yer a-meditatin’ and a-planning. ’E knows the wages\\nyer’ll ’ave ter take for it. ’E sees the conserquences. And the\\nconserquences is death. Death ter self-respec’! Death ter ’uman\\nh’affection! Death ter the woman and children yer love! Death ter ’ope\\nand purity! Damnation ter yer soul! ’Ave yer thought o’ that? Death!\\nDeath! Death!”\\n\\nHe hissed the words, speaking slower and slower. His voice died away in\\nan awestruck whisper. In the pause that followed, the quiet was broken\\nby a shrill laugh. All heads turned. On the outskirts of the crowd stood\\n“Lady Halloway.” She had evidently been drinking. A foolish smile played\\nabout her mouth. Her lips were swollen. She mimicked the evangelist in a\\nhoarse, cracked voice, “Death! Death! Death!”\\n\\nI signed to Vi. Going first, carrying Dorrie in my arms, I commenced to\\nforce a passage. We had become wedged against the wall. Our going caused\\na ripple of disturbance. Attention was distracted from “Lady Halloway”\\n to ourselves. She turned her glazed eyes on us. Stupid with drink, she\\ndid not recognize me at first. I had to pass beneath the lantern quite\\nnear her. As the light struck across my face, she saw who I was. “’E’s\\ngot another gal,” she tittered so all could hear her. “It’s easy come\\nand easy go-a. Love ’ere ter-day and thar ter-morrer. Good-evenin’,\\nSir Dante Cardover, that is ter be. And ’oo’s yer noo sweet-’art? Is\\nshe as pretty h’as me? Let a poor gal ’ave a look at ’er.”\\n\\nI pushed by her roughly. She would have followed, but some of the crowd\\nrestrained her. She made a grab at Vi. I could hear Vi’s dress rending.\\n“So I ain’t good ’nough!” she shouted. “I ain’t good ’nough for yer!\\nAnd ’oo are you ter despise me, I’d like ter h’arsk?”\\n\\nShe said a lot more, but her voice was drowned in a protesting clamor.\\nI turned my head as I crossed the station-yard. Beneath the evangelist’s\\nlantern I saw her arms tossing. Her hair had broken loose. Her eyes\\nfollowed us. I entered the station and saw no more. Not until we had\\nslipped through the barrier on to the platform did we slacken. Even\\nwhile loathing her for her display of bestiality, my grandmother’s words\\ncame back to me, “She was as nice and kind a little girl as there was in\\nRansby, until that rascal, Lord Halloway, ruined her.”\\n\\nWe found that the porter, with whom we had left our luggage, had secured\\nthree seats for us. Two of them were corners. I took mine with my back\\nto the engine, so that Vi and I sat facing one another. Dorrie sat\\nbeside Vi for a few minutes, uncomfortably, with her legs dangling. Then\\nshe slipped to the floor and climbing up my knees, snuggled herself down\\nin my arms.\\n\\n“We’ll have fine timeth in London together, won’t we?” she questioned.\\n“I’m tho glad you’s toming.”\\n\\nIt was strange how difficult I found it to speak to Vi. I wanted to\\nsay so much. I knew I ought to say something. Yet all I could think to\\nmention was some reference to what had happened beside the harbor--and\\nthat was so contaminating that I wanted to forget it. Luckily, just\\nthen, an old countrywoman bundled in with a basket on her arm.\\n\\n“Gooing ter Lun’non, me dear?” she asked of Vi. “Well, ter be sure,\\nI intend ter goo ter Lun’non some day. I get out at Beccles, the nex’\\nstop.” Lowering her voice, “That your little gal, and ’usband, bor?\\nNot your ’usband! Well, ’e do seem fond o’ your little gal, now doan’t\\n’e, just the same as if ’e wuz ’er father?”\\n\\nThe train began to move. The lights of Ransby flashed by, twinkling\\nand growing smaller. We thundered across the bridge which separates the\\nBroads from the harbor.\\n\\nVi and the countrywoman were talking, or rather the countrywoman was\\ntalking and Vi was paying feigned attention. Dorrie, her flaxen curls\\nfalling across my shoulder, began to nod. Of the other passengers,\\none was drowsing and the other, a fierce be-whiskered little man, was\\nreading a paper, leaning forward to catch the glimmering light which\\nfell from the lamp in the center of the carriage. I was left alone with\\nmy thoughts.\\n\\nThey were not pleasant. The religious commonsense of the man by the\\nharbor disturbed me. The face of “Lady Halloway” proved the truth of his\\nassertions. His words would not be silenced. Strident and accusing,\\nthey rose, above the rumbling of the train, and wove themselves into\\na maddening chorus: “_The wages of sin is death; the wages of sin is\\ndeath; the wages of sin is death_.” A man whose intellect I despised,\\nto whose opinions I should ordinarily pay no attention, had spoken\\ntruth--and I had heard it.\\n\\nAt Beccles the train stopped. The countrywoman alighted. The drowsy man\\nwoke up and followed her. The fierce little man curled himself up in his\\ncorner and spread his paper over his face to shut out the light. There\\nwere four hours more until we reached London. The train resumed its\\njourney through the dark.\\n\\nI dared not stir for fear of waking Dorrie.\\n\\n“Comfortable, Vi?”\\n\\nShe nodded and leant her face against the cushioned back of the\\ncarriage, closing her eyes. I watched her pure profile--the arched\\neyebrows, the heavy eyelids, the straight nose, the full and pouting\\nmouth, the rounded chin, the long, sensuous curve of the graceful neck.\\nI traced the small blue veins beneath the transparent whiteness of\\nher temples. I studied her beauty, committing it to memory. Then\\nI commenced to compare her with Dorrie, discovering the likeness. I\\nwondered whether I had first felt drawn to her because she was so like\\nDorrie, or only for herself.\\n\\nI looked up from Dorrie, and found Vi gazing at me.\\n\\nI had thought her sleeping.\\n\\n“Just wakened?”\\n\\n“I’ve been awake all the time. I’ve been thinking.”\\n\\n“Of what?”\\n\\n“Last night. How different it was! We didn’t have to hide. No one was\\nlooking.”\\n\\n“Then we’ll go again to where no one is looking.”\\n\\n“We can’t always do that. But I was thinking of something else.”\\n\\n“What was it this time?”\\n\\nShe pressed her cheek against the glass of the window, gazing out into\\nthe night. Then she leant over to me, clasping her hands. “How cruel it\\nwas, what he said to us!”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“The man there in Ransby.”\\n\\n“But he didn’t speak to us. He was one of those people who shout at\\nstreet-corners because they like to hear their own voices.”\\n\\n“He was speaking to me,” she said, “though he didn’t know it.”\\n\\n“Vi, you’re not growing nervous?”\\n\\n“That isn’t the word. I’m looking forward and thinking how horrid it\\nwould be to have to hide always.”\\n\\n“We shan’t.”\\n\\nShe looked at Dorrie, making no reply.\\n\\nPresently she spoke again. “Dante, have you ever thought of it? I’m four\\nyears older than you are.”\\n\\n“No, I’ve never thought of it.”\\n\\n“You ought to.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because four years makes a lot of difference in a woman. You’ll look\\nstill young when I’m turning forty.”\\n\\n“Pooh!”\\n\\nShe ignored my attempt to turn from the topic. “If--if we should ever\\ndo anything rash, people would say that I was a scheming woman; that\\nI’d taken advantage of you; that, being the elder, I ought to have known\\nbetter.”\\n\\nThe idea of Vi leading me astray was so supremely ridiculous that I\\nlaughed outright. Dorrie stirred, and gazed up in my face. “Dear Dante!”\\n she muttered, and sank back again.\\n\\n“Her father will be waiting for the cable,” said Vi.\\n\\nI wondered if this was the kind of conversation my father and mother\\nhad carried on all those years ago when they ran away. I felt that if my\\narms were only free to place about her, all would be well.\\n\\n“We shall have to tell him, Vi,” I whispered.\\n\\nShe pretended not to hear me. Her eyes were closed. One hand shaded them\\nfrom the light. She was again playing hide-and-seek with the purpose of\\nour errand.\\n\\nThe rumble of the wheels droned on. I planned for what I would do when\\nthe train reached London and the moment of decision should arrive.\\n\\nPerhaps two hours passed in silence. The glare of London was growing in\\nthe distance. Towns and houses became more frequent. One had glimpses of\\nillumined windows and silhouettes against the blinds. Each house meant a\\nproblem as large to someone as mine was to me. The fact that life was so\\nteeming and various robbed my crisis of its isolated augustness. Locals\\nmet us with a crash like thunder. As we flashed by, I could glance into\\ntheir carriages and see men and women, all of whom, at some time\\nin their existence, would decide just such problems of love and\\nself-fulfilment--to each one of them the decision would seem vital to\\nthe universe, and in each case it would be relatively trivial. How easy\\nto do what one liked unnoticed in such a crowded world! How preposterous\\nthat theory of the man by the harbor! As if any God could have time to\\nfollow the individual doings of such a host of cheese-mites!\\n\\nOur fellow-traveler in the corner woke and removed the paper from before\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n“Wife tired?”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s a tedious journey.”\\n\\nIt was too much trouble to correct him as to our exact relations.\\n\\nHe cleared the misty panes and looked out at a vanishing station.\\n“Stratford. We’ll be there in a quarter of an hour. Live in London?”\\n\\n“Yes. At least, sometimes.”\\n\\nHe commenced to get his baggage together, keeping up his desultory\\nvolley of questions.\\n\\nWe entered the last tunnel. I touched Vi’s hand.\\n\\n“We’re pulling into Liverpool Street. Do you want to claim your boxes\\nto-night or to-morrow?”\\n\\n“To-morrow’ll do,” she said.\\n\\nA porter jumped on the step of our carriage. Our fellow-traveler\\nalighted, refusing his assistance. The man climbed in and, shouldering\\nour luggage, inquired whether we wanted a cab.\\n\\n“Where to?” he asked.\\n\\nI turned to Vi. “Where’ll we stay?”\\n\\nShe slipped her arm through mine and drew me aside. The porter went\\nforward to engage the cabby.\\n\\n“Give me one more night alone with Dorrie,” she whispered. “Everything\\nhas been so--so hurried. You understand, dearest, don’t you?”\\n\\nI helped her into the four-wheeler and lifted Dorrie after her. Having\\ntold the man to drive to the _Cecil_, I was about to enter. She checked\\nme. “We shall be able to get on all right.” Then, in the darkness of\\nthe cab, her arms went passionately about my neck, and, all pretense\\nabandoned, I felt her warm lips pressed against my mouth.\\n\\nAs the door banged Dorrie roused. Seeing me standing on the platform,\\nshe stretched her arms out of the window, crying, “Oh, I fought you was\\ntoming wiv’ us, Dante.”\\n\\n“Not to-night, darling,” said Vi.\\n\\n“To-morrow,” I promised her. Then to Vi, “I’ll be round at the _Cecil_\\nshortly after ten. Will that do?”\\n\\nShe nodded. I watched them drive away, after which I jumped into a\\nhansom and set off to pay Pope Lane a surprise visit.\\n\\nI could not sleep that night; was making plans. The haste with which\\nthis step had been approached and taken had terrified Vi. I had been\\nunwise. Her sensitiveness had been shocked by the raw way in which a\\ndesire takes shape in action. And the man by the harbor had upset her. I\\nmust get her away to a cottage in the country, where we could be\\nalone, and where she would have time to grow accustomed to our altered\\nrelations.\\n\\nNext morning, full of these arrangements, I sought her at the _Hotel\\nCecil_.\\n\\nShe was not there; the office had no record of her. I remembered that\\nher boxes had been left at Liverpool Street overnight. When I got there\\nand made inquiries of the clerk, I found that the lady I described had\\nbeen to the baggage-room an hour before me and had claimed them. After\\nmuch difficulty I hunted out the cabman who had driven her. He showed me\\nalcoholic sympathy, at once divining the irregularity of our relations,\\nand told me that the lady had countermanded my orders and instructed\\nhim to drive her to the _Hotel Thackeray_. I arrived at the _Hotel\\nThackeray_ in time to be informed that she had already left.\\n\\nFour days later I received a letter which had been sent on from Ransby.\\nIt was from Vi, despatched with the pilot from the ship on which she was\\nsailing to America.\\n\\nShe had not dared to see me again, she said. She was running away from\\nthe temptation to be selfish. She had reckoned up the price which her\\nhusband, Dorrie, and myself would have to pay that she might gain her\\nhappiness; she had no right to exact it. As far as her husband and\\nDorrie were concerned, if we had done what we had contemplated, we\\nshould have shattered something for them which we could never replace.\\nShe was going back to do her duty. That the task might not be made too\\ndifficult, she begged me not to write.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X--PUPPETS OF DESIRE\\n\\nI returned to Oxford. My rooms at Lazarus were in Fellows’ Quad--one\\nwas a big room in which I lived and worked, the other was a small\\nbedroom leading out of it. My windows overlooked the smooth lawns and\\ngravel paths of the college garden. Flowers were over, hanging\\ncrumpled and brown on their withered stalks. Here and there, a solitary\\nlate-blooming rose shone faintly. The garden stood upon the city-wall,\\noverlooking the meadows of the Broad Walk. Every evening white mists\\nfrom the river invaded it, billowing across the open spaces, breaking\\nagainst the shrubs, climbing higher and higher, till the tops of the\\ntrees were covered. Sitting beside my fire I could hear the leaves\\nrustle, and turning my head could see them falling.\\n\\nThe ceiling of my living-room was low; the walls were paneled in white\\nfrom bottom to top. The furniture was covered in warm red. The hearth\\nwas deep and the fender of polished steel, which reflected the glow of\\nthe coals when the day drew near its close. It was a room in which to\\nsit quietly, to think, and to grow drowsy.\\n\\nIt was October when I returned. Meadows were turning from green to\\nash-color. Virginia-creeper flared like scarlet flame against pale\\nwalls. The contented melancholy of the austere city was healing. It\\ncured feverishness by turning one’s thoughts away from the present. In\\nits stoic calm it was like an old man--one who had grown indifferent to\\nthe world’s changefulness. In healthy contrast to its ancientness was\\nthe exuberant youth of the undergrads.\\n\\nMost grief arises from a thwarted sense of one’s own importance. Here,\\namong broken records of the past, the impermanence of physical existence\\nwas written plainly.\\n\\nDefaced hopes of the ages encountered one at every corner. Of all the\\nmen who had wrought here, nothing but the best of what they had thought\\nstood fast; their personalities, the fashion of their daily lives were\\nlost beneath the dust of decades. No place could have been found better\\nin which to doctor a wounded heart.\\n\\nThrough the winter that followed Vi’s departure, the new conception I\\nhad of her nobility upheld me. I could not sink beneath her standard of\\nhonor. When the temptation to write to her came over me, I shamed myself\\ninto setting it aside.\\n\\nI recognized now what would have been the inevitable penalty, had we\\nfollowed our inclination that night. Only the madness of the moment\\ncould have blinded me to its result. We should have become persons cast\\noff by society--insecure even in our claim on one another’s affections,\\ncontinually fleeing from the lean greyhound of remorse. Never for a\\nday should we have been permitted to forget the irregularity of our\\nrelation. We should have been continually apologizing for our fault. We\\nshould have been continually hiding from curious, unfriendly eyes. The\\nshame with which other people regarded us would have re-acted on our\\ncharacters. And then there was Dorrie! She would have had to know one\\nday.\\n\\nWe had the man by the harbor and “Lady Halloway” to thank for our\\nescape. The strange combination of influences they had exerted at our\\nhour of crisis, had saved us.\\n\\nBlack moments came when I gazed ahead into the vacant future. I must\\ngo through life without her. Unless some circumstance unforeseen should\\narise, we would never meet again. Then I felt that, to possess her, no\\nprice of disgrace would be too high to pay.\\n\\nI trained myself like an athlete to defeat the despair which such\\nthoughts occasioned. I tried to banish her from my mind. In my conscious\\nmoments I succeeded by keeping myself occupied. But in sleep she came to\\nme in all manner of intimate and forbidden ways.\\n\\nI crowded my hours with work that I might keep true to my purpose. And\\nyet this method of fighting, when analyzed, consisted chiefly in running\\naway. I took up tutorial duties at my college. I commenced to make\\nstudies for a biography of that typical genius of the Renaissance, half\\nlibertine, half mystic, Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini, known to history\\nin his old age as Pope Pius II. I tried to fill up my leisure with new\\nfriendships. In none of these things could I become truly interested.\\nMy thoughts were crossing the ocean. When I was deepest in study I would\\nstart, hearing her voice, sharp and poignant.\\n\\nOne afternoon I was sitting with my chair drawn up to the hearth, my\\nfeet on the fender, a board across my knees, trying to write. A tap fell\\non the door. Lord Halloway entered.\\n\\nHe took a seat on the other side of the fireplace. “I’ve been wanting to\\nspeak to you for some time,” he said, “wanting to explain.”\\n\\n“Wanting to explain what?”\\n\\n“Myself in general. You don’t like me; I think you’re mistaken. I’m not\\nthe man I was.”\\n\\n“But why should you explain to me?”\\n\\n“Because I like you.”\\n\\n“Don’t see why you should. Woadley’s probably coming to me--which you\\nonce thought was to be yours.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t worry me. I’ll have the Lovegrove estates when my father\\ndies. But I don’t like to feel that any man despises me--it hampers a\\nchap in trying to do right. You pass me in the quads with a nod, and\\nhurry as you go by so that I shan’t stop you. Why?”\\n\\n“Want to know the truth?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“It’s because of the woman they call ‘Lady Halloway’ and all the other\\ngirls you’ve ruined.”\\n\\n“I thought it. That was why I wanted to tell you that I’m done with that\\nway of life. I was a colossal ass in the old days. But, you know, a good\\nmany fellows have been what I was, and they’ve married, and settled down\\nand become respected.”\\n\\n“And what of the girls they’ve ruined?”\\n\\nHe leant forward, clasping his hands and spreading his knees apart.\\n“You’re blaming me for the injustices of society. Women have always had\\nto suffer. But I’ve always done the sportsmanlike thing by the girls\\nI’ve wronged. All of them are provided for.”\\n\\n“These things are your own affairs,” I said shortly; “but I’ve always\\nfelt----”\\n\\n“Felt what?”\\n\\n“Felt that the most disreputable thing about most prodigals is the\\nmethod of their returning. They leave all the women they’ve deceived\\nand all their bastards in the Far Country with the swine and the husks,\\nwhile they hobble home to forgiveness and luxury. Simply because\\nthey acknowledge the obvious--that they’ve sinned and disgraced their\\nfathers--they expect to escape the rewards of their profligacy. It’s\\ncheap, Halloway. You speak as though marriage will re-instate your\\nmorals. A man should be able to bring a clean record to the woman he\\nmarries.” The off-hand manner in which he referred to his villainies had\\nmade me cold with a sense of justice. His lolling, fashionably attired\\nperson and his glib assertion that he had done with that way of life,\\nroused my anger when I remembered his idiot son and the scene on the\\nesplanade. He regarded me with a friendly man-of-the-world smile,\\npointing his delicate fingers one against the other. I would have liked\\nhim better had he shown resentment.\\n\\n“You make things hard,” he objected. “If everyone thought as you do,\\nthere’d be no incentive for reformation. The man who had been a little\\nwild would never be anything else. According to your way of thinking,\\nhe’d be more estimable as a rake than as the father of a family. You\\nshut the door against all coming back.”\\n\\nHe spoke reasonably, trying to lift what had started as a personal\\nattack, on to the impartial plane of a sociological discussion.\\n\\n“It’s the unfairness of it that irks me,” I said. “You tempt a girl and\\nleave her to her disgrace. She bears both her own and your share of the\\nscandal, while you scramble back into respectability. If you brought her\\nback with you, I shouldn’t object. But, after you’ve persuaded her to go\\ndown into the pit, you draw up the ladder and walk away.”\\n\\nHe gave his high-pitched laugh. “That’s how the world’s made. It’s none\\nof my doing. If I married one of these girls, neither of us would be\\nhappy. One of these days I shall be Earl of Lovegrove. They’re better as\\nthey are. You know that, surely?”\\n\\n“I suppose so.”\\n\\n“Then, why prevent me, when I’m trying to get on to higher ground? I\\nknow I’ve been a rotter. I’ve made a mess of things. I don’t need anyone\\nto remind me.”\\n\\nI held out my hand, saying, “I’ve been censorious. I’m sorry.”\\n\\nAfter this he dropped in often to see me. He was coaching the Lazarus\\ntoggers that autumn; his usual time for calling was between four and\\nfive, on his way up from the river. I got to know him well and to look\\nfor him. His big robustness and high color filled the student atmosphere\\nof my room with an air of outdoor vitality. He was always cheerful. And\\nyet I could not get away from the idea that he was making use of me for\\nsome undisclosed purpose.\\n\\nHe was an egoist at heart--a charming egoist. Much of his conversation\\nturned about himself. “Now that you know me better, do you still think\\nthat I’m barred from marriage?” he would ask.\\n\\n“All kinds of people marry. It still seems unfair to me that, after\\nknocking about the way you have, you should marry anyone who doesn’t\\nknow the world pretty thoroughly.”\\n\\n“You mean I’m tarnished and should marry a woman who is tarnished.\\nYou don’t understand me, Cardover. My very knowledge of evil makes me\\nworship feminine purity.”\\n\\nIt was difficult to regard Lord Halloway as tarnished when you looked\\nat his splendid body. His healthy physical handsomeness seemed an\\nexcuse for his transgressions. He upset all your ideas of the degrading\\ninfluences of immorality.\\n\\nAfter Christmas I had Ruthita down to stay at Oxford. We were walking\\nalong the tow-path towards Iffley on the afternoon of her arrival, when\\nthe Lazarus Eight went by. Halloway was mounted, riding along the bank,\\nshouting orders to the cox. As he passed us, he recognized Ruthita. I\\nsaw her color flame up. She halted abruptly, following him with her eyes\\nround the bend of the river.\\n\\n“Shall we meet them again if we go on?”\\n\\nI told her we should be certain to meet them, as they would turn at\\nIffley Lock.\\n\\n“But I don’t want to meet them.” Then, in a whisper, “I’m afraid of him,\\nDante.”\\n\\nWe retraced our steps to Folly Bridge and walked out to Hinksey to avoid\\nhim.\\n\\n“You’re an odd little creature, Ruthie. Why on earth should you be\\nafraid of him? He can’t do you any harm.”\\n\\n“It’s his eyes. When he looks at me so hard, I forget all that I know\\nabout him, and begin to like him. And then, when he’s gone, I come to\\nmyself and feel humiliated.”\\n\\nNow that I had found someone who would run him down, I changed sides and\\nbegan to plead his cause. “Seems to me it’s a bit rough on the chap to\\nremember his old faults. He’s quite changed.”\\n\\n“But the woman at Ransby hasn’t,” she retorted bitterly. “He didn’t\\nleave her a chance.”\\n\\nIt was pleasant having Ruthita with me. I liked to hear the swish of her\\nskirts as she walked, and to feel the light pressure of her hand upon my\\narm. She spoke with her face tilted up to mine. It was such a tiny face,\\nso emotional and innocent. The frost in the air had brought a color to\\nher cheeks and a luster to her hair. She loved to make me feel that she\\nwas my possession for the moment; I knew that I pleased her when I\\nused her as though she were all mine. We treated one another with frank\\naffection.\\n\\n“D’you ever hear from Vi?” she asked.\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“It was awfully strange the way she left Ransby--so suddenly, without\\nsaying good-by. I had just one little note from her before she sailed;\\nthat was all. I’ve written to her several times since then, but she’s\\nnever answered.”\\n\\nI turned the subject by saying, “What’s this about Uncle Obad? Is he\\ngiving up the boarding-house?”\\n\\n“Yes, he’s going down into Surrey to raise fowls. He’s already got his\\nfarm. Aunt Lavinia’s wild about it.”\\n\\n“But where does he get his money?”\\n\\n“Nobody knows, and he refuses to tell. Papa says that he must have found\\nanother Rapson.”\\n\\n“But he isn’t selling shares again, is he?”\\n\\n“Oh dear no. He’s become wonderfully independent, and says he doesn’t\\nneed to make his poultry pay. It’s just a hobby.”\\n\\n“Dear old chap! I hope he doesn’t come another cropper.”\\n\\n“He says he can’t, but he won’t explain why. And d’you know, I believe\\nhe’s given Papa back the two thousand pounds that he lost.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it. What makes you think that?”\\n\\n“Because Papa’s stopped talking against him, and because I caught him\\nlooking up those guide-books to Italy again.”\\n\\nWe turned off from the Abingdon Road and curved round to the left\\nthrough the sheep-farms of Hinksey. Hedges bristled bare on either side.\\nUplands rose bleak against the steely sky. Rutted lanes were brittle\\nbeneath our feet, crusted over here and there with ice. On thatched\\nroofs of cottages sparrows squatted with ruffled feathers. Icicles hung\\ndown from spouts. The lambing season was just commencing. As we drew\\nnear farms the warm smell of sheep packed close together assailed our\\nnostrils. From far and wide a constant, distressful bleating went up.\\nQuickly and silently, rising out of the ground, dropping down from the\\nsky, darkness closed in about us. In the cup of the valley, with the\\nriver sweeping round it, lay Oxford with its glistening towers and\\nchurch spires. Little pin-points of fire sprang up, shining hard and\\nfrosty through the winter’s shadows. They raced through the city, as\\nthough a hundred lamp-lighters had wakened at once and were making up\\nfor lost time. Soon the somber mass was a blazing jewel, flinging up a\\ngolden blur into the night.\\n\\nRuthita hugged my arm. “Doesn’t it make you glad to be alive? I’m never\\nso happy as when I’m alone with you, Dante. It isn’t what we say that\\ndoes it. It’s just being near one another.”\\n\\nShe spoke like a child, groping after words, feeling far more than\\nshe could ever utter. But I knew what she meant. The woman in her was\\nstriving. Just as her flowerlike womanhood, unfolding itself to me\\nsecretly, made me hungry for Vi, so my masculinity stung her into\\nwistful eagerness for a man’s affection.\\n\\n“You’re a queer little kiddie. What you need’s a husband. I shall be\\nfrightfully jealous of him. At first I shall almost hate him.”\\n\\n“If you hated him, I shouldn’t marry him. Besides, I don’t believe I\\nshall ever marry.”\\n\\nWe trudged back to Oxford in a gay mood, carrying on a bantering\\nconversation. When we had entered Lazarus, I left her at the lodge,\\ntelling her to go to Fellows’ Quad while I ordered tea at the pantry. As\\nI approached my rooms, I heard the sound of voices. Opening the door, I\\nsaw the lamp had not been lit. By the flare of the fire, I made out the\\nprofile of Ruthita as she leant back in the arm-chair, resting her feet\\non the fender. Standing up, looking down on her, with his arm against\\nthe mantelshelf was Lord Halloway.\\n\\nHe glanced towards me in his careless fashion. “This is quite the\\npleasantest thing that could have happened. I’ve often thought about\\nthe drive to Woadley and wondered whether we three should ever meet all\\ntogether again.” Then, turning to Ruthita, “Your brother’s so secretive,\\nMiss Cardover. He never breathed a word about your coming.”\\n\\n“My sister’s name is not Cardover,” I corrected him.\\n\\nHe drew himself to his full height languidly. “I must apologize for\\nhaving misnamed you, Miss--Miss----”\\n\\n“My name is Favart,” put in Ruthita.\\n\\n“Isn’t it strange,” he asked, “that a brother and sister should be named\\ndifferently?”\\n\\nThen I had another illustration of how he could draw out women’s\\nconfidence. Ruthita had just run three miles in the opposite direction\\nto avoid him, yet here she was eagerly telling him many things that were\\nmost intimate--all about her father and the Siege of Paris, and how\\nI climbed the wall and discovered her, and how we had run off to get\\nmarried and stayed with the gipsies in the forest.\\n\\nThe tea-boy came and set crumpets and muffins down by the hearth. I lit\\nthe lamp. Still they went on talking, referring to me occasionally, but\\npaying little heed to my presence.\\n\\nThe bell began to toll for Hall.\\n\\nHalloway rose. “How long are you going to be in Oxford, Miss Favart?”\\n\\n“That depends on Dante, and how long he will have me.\\n\\n“Then you’re staying a little while?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I ask, because I’d like to take Cardover and yourself out driving. I\\nhave my horses in Oxford and you ought to see some of the country.”\\n\\n“That depends on Dante.”\\n\\n“We’ll talk it over to-morrow,” I said brusquely.\\n\\nFor the next few days, wherever we went we were unaccountably coming\\nacross Halloway. He always expressed surprise at meeting us, and always\\nmade himself delightful after we had met. If we walked out to Cumnor, or\\nSandford or Godstow, it made no difference in which direction, we were\\nsure to hear the sharp trit-trotting of his tandem, and to see his high\\nred dog-cart gaining on us above the hedges. Then he would rein up, with\\na display of amazed pleasure at these repeated accidents, and insist on\\nour mounting beside him. Ruthita told me that she was annoyed at the way\\nhe broke up our privacy; but her annoyance was saved entirely for his\\nabsence. In his company she allowed him to absorb her.\\n\\nI had accompanied Ruthita back to the _Mitre_, where she was staying. It\\nwas her last night. On returning to my rooms, I found Halloway waiting.\\nI was surprised, for the hour was late. I noticed that his manner was\\nunusually serious and pre-occupied for such an habitual trifler. When I\\nhad mixed him a whiskey and soda, I sat down and watched him. He tapped\\nhis teeth with his thumbnail.\\n\\nI grew restless. “What is it?” I asked. “Something on your mind?”\\n\\n“Don’t know how to express it. You’ve made it difficult for me.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“By the things you’ve said from time to time. You see, it’s this way.\\nUntil I met Miss Favart I was quite unashamed of myself. Her purity and\\ngoodness made me view myself in a new light. Since then I’ve tried to\\nretrieve my past to some extent. Of course, I can never be worthy of\\nher, but----”\\n\\n“Worthy of her! I don’t understand.” I leant forward in my chair,\\nfrowning.\\n\\n“You do understand,” he said quietly. “You must have guessed it from the\\nfirst. I’m in love with her and intend to make her my wife.”\\n\\n“Intend!” I repeated.\\n\\nHe rose to his feet, as though willing to show me his fine body, and\\nbegan to pace the room with the stealthy tread of a panther. He kept\\nhis eyes on mine. When he spoke there was a purring determination in his\\nvoice.\\n\\n“Yes, intend. I’ve always had my way with women. You’ll see; I shan’t\\nfail this time. I may have to wait, perhaps.”\\n\\n“Halloway,” I said, “I don’t suppose you’re capable of realizing how\\ndecent people feel about you. Of course there are many men who disguise\\ntheir feelings when they see you trying to do better. But very few of\\nthose same men would introduce you to their sisters, or daughters, or\\nwives. To put it plainly, they’d feel they were insulting them. So now\\nyou know how I feel about what you’ve just told me.”\\n\\nHe paused above me, looking down with an amused smile.\\n\\n“My dear Cardover, that’s just what I expected from you. You virgin men\\nare so brutally honest where your ideals are concerned--so hopelessly\\nevasive in facing up to realities. Don’t you know that life _is_ a\\ncoarse affair? I’ve lived it naturally--most strong men have at some\\ntime. I’ve been open in what I’ve done. Everybody knows the worst there\\nis to know about me. Most men do these things in secret. I couldn’t be\\nsecret and preserve my self-respect. Skeletons in the cupboard ar’n’t\\nmuch in my line. Ruthita knows me at my wickedest now; when she knows me\\nat my best, she’ll love me.”\\n\\n“When my sister marries,” I said coldly, “it’ll be to a man who can\\nbring her something better than the dregs of his debaucheries.”\\n\\nHe gave his foolish laugh. “That’s a new name for the Lovegrove titles.\\nI’d better be going. If I stay longer, you may make me angry.”\\n\\nI rose to see him take his departure. He had passed out and gone a few\\nsteps down the passage, when I heard him returning. The door just opened\\nwide enough for him to look in on me. “My dear Cardover,” he said, “I\\ncame back to remind you of another of those evasive realities. You know,\\nshe isn’t your sister.”\\n\\nA week later I received an indignant letter from Ruthita, saying that\\nLord Halloway had been to Pope Lane to see my father, and had asked for\\nher hand in marriage. She had refused even to see him. By the same mail\\ncame a letter from the Snow Lady, couched in milder terms and asking for\\ninformation. She wanted to know whether Halloway was as black as he was\\npainted. I referred her to Ruthita, telling her to ask her to describe\\nwhat happened on the esplanade. As a result I received a final letter,\\nagreeing with me that the matter was impossible, but at the same time\\nenlarging on the wealth and prestige of the Lovegrove earldom.\\n\\nFor a fortnight I refused to have anything to do with my cousin, but\\nhis imperturbable good-humor made rancor impossible. In the cabined\\nintimacies of college life a quarrel was awkward. To the aristocratic\\nmuch is forgiven; moreover he was a splendid all-round athlete and one\\nof the hardest riders to hounds that the ’Varsity had ever had. So he\\nwas popular with dons and undergraduates alike. One morning when he\\nstopped me in Merton Street, offering me his hand, I took it, agreeing\\nto renew his acquaintance. My commonsense told me that the defeated\\nparty had most cause for grievance. His sporting lack of bitterness sent\\nhim up in my estimation.\\n\\nSpring broke late on the world that year in a foam of flowers. Like\\na swollen tide it swept through our valley in wanton riot and stormed\\nacross the walls of our gray old town. It surged into shadowy cloisters\\nand dashed up in spray of may-blossom and lilac. Every tree was crested\\nwith the flying foam of its hurry. The Broad Walk, leading down to the\\nbarges, was white with blown bloom of chestnuts.\\n\\nQuadrangles became gay with geraniums. Through open windows music\\nand men’s laughter sounded. Flanneled figures, carrying rackets and\\ncricket-bats, shot hither and thither on bicycles. At evening, in the\\nstreets beneath college windows, groups of strolling minstrels strummed\\non banjos and sang. Fresh-faced girls, sweethearts and sisters of\\nthe undergraduates, drifted up and down our monastic by-ways, smiling\\neagerly into their escort’s eyes, leaving behind them ripples of\\nexcitement.\\n\\nAll live things were mating. The instinct for love was in the air. My\\nlonging for Vi was quickened. The sight of girls’ faces filled me\\nwith poignancy. Every beauty of sound, or sight, or fragrance became\\ncommemorative of her. By day I traced her resemblance in the features of\\nstrangers. Inflamed desire wove tapestries of passion on the canvas of\\nthe night. Roaming through lanes of the countryside, I would meet young\\nlovers in secluded places, and flee from them in a tempest of envy. Had\\nshe sent me one little sign that she still cared, I would have abandoned\\neverything and have gone to claim her. My mind was burning. I poured\\nout my heart to her in letters which, instead of sending, I destroyed. I\\nbecame afraid.\\n\\nHalloway was in the same plight. He never mentioned Ruthita; but he\\nwould come to my room, and pause before her photograph and fall\\nsilent. However, he knew how to shuffle his fortune to convenience his\\nenvironment. He had his comforters. Gorgeous young females fluttered in\\nand out of his apartments, like painted butterflies. His only discretion\\nwas in the numbers of his choice. They might have been the daughters\\nof dukes by their appearance, but you knew they were chorus-girls from\\nLondon. One day when I questioned him, he threw me a cynical smile,\\nsaying, “I’m trying the expulsive power of a new affection.”\\n\\nThe phrase took root. If I was to do the honorable thing by Vi, I also\\nmust employ my heart in a new direction. The thing was easy to say, but\\nit seemed impossible that I should ever be attracted by another woman.\\n\\nIt had become my habit to spend much of my time sitting by the open\\nwindow of my room, gazing out into the college garden. Hyacinths,\\ntulips, crocuses bubbled up from beneath the turf. Every day brought a\\nchange. In the spring breeze the garden tossed and nodded, applauding\\nits own endeavor. Songsters had returned to their last year’s nests.\\nFrom morn to dusk they caroled in the shrubberies. Twittering their\\nlove-songs or trailing straws, they flashed across gulfs which separated\\nthe chestnuts. Over Bagley Wood, as I sat at work, I could hear the\\ncuckoo calling. From the unseen river came the shouting of coaches to\\ntheir crews, and the long and regular roll of oars as they turned in\\ntheir rowlocks.\\n\\nI glanced up from my books one evening. The glow of sunset, hovered\\nalong the city-wall. Leaning over its edge, looking down into the\\nmeadows, a tall girl was standing. Her back was towards me. She was\\ndressed in the palest green. Her hair was auburn. She held her skirt\\ndaringly high, disclosing the daintiest of ankles. Her open-work\\nstockings were also of green to match the rest of her attire. Her\\ncompanion was Brookins, the assistant chaplain, an effeminate little\\nman, who was known among the undergraduates as the doe-priest. He seemed\\nill at ease; she was manifestly flirting with him. In the stillness of\\nthe garden the penetrating cadence of her gay voice reached me. It was\\nfriendly, and had the lazy caressing quality of a summer’s afternoon\\nwhen bees are humming in and out of flowers. I was tantalized by a\\nhaunting memory. She turned her face part way towards me. I caught her\\nmocking profile. The way the red-gold curls fell across her forehead\\nwas familiar; and yet I could not remember. She came along the terrace,\\nwalking in long, slow, undulating strides. The west shone full upon\\nher. She was brilliant and gracious, and carried herself with an air of\\nchallenging pride. Her tall, slim figure broke into exquisite lines as\\nshe walked, revealing its shapely frailty. Her narrow face, with its\\narch expression of innocence, promised a personality full of secrets and\\ndisguises.\\n\\nI stepped across the sill of my window into the garden. They were near\\nenough now for me to catch an occasional word of their conversation.\\nI approached across the lawn towards them. She glanced in my direction\\ncasually; then she steadied her gaze. I saw that her eyes were green,\\nspecked with gold about the iris. She stooped her head, still gazing at\\nme, and asked a question of the doe-priest in a lowered voice. I heard\\nhim speak my name. A bubbling laugh sprang from her lips. She came\\ntripping towards me with her hand extended.\\n\\n“You’re not going to pretend you don’t know me?”\\n\\n“I do know you, and yet I can’t recall where we have met or what is your\\nname.”\\n\\n“Were you ever in Sneard’s garden at the Red House?”\\n\\n“You’re------”\\n\\n“Fiesole Cortona, and you’re Dante.”\\n\\nWe stood there holding one another’s hands, searching one another’s\\nfaces and laughing gladly.\\n\\n“Well I never!” I kept repeating. “Fancy meeting you after all these\\nyears!”\\n\\n“Am I much changed?” she questioned.\\n\\n“You’re more beautiful,” I said boldly.\\n\\nShe nodded her head roguishly. “I can see you’re no longer afraid\\nof girls. You were once, you remember.” The doe-priest had stood by\\nwatching us nervously. It was plain that Fiesole had scared him--he\\nwas glad to be relieved of her. The bell in the tower began to toll for\\ndinner. Brookins jangled his keys, edging towards the gate.\\n\\n“Poor Mr. Brookins, are you hungry? Must you be going?”\\n\\n“I don’t like to be late at high table, Miss Cortona,” he replied\\nstiffly. “The Warden is very particular about punctuality.”\\n\\n“Never mind, Brookins,” I said, “I’ll look after Miss Cortona. You cut\\nalong.”\\n\\nBrookins made his farewells with more alacrity than politeness. Fiesole\\ngazed after his departing figure with mischievous merriment in her eyes.\\n\\n“He thinks me a dangerous person,” she pouted. “He thinks I was luring\\nhim on to be naughty. He’ll go and preach a sermon about me. He’s\\nbristling with righteousness. And now that he’s managed to escape,\\nhe’s locking poor innocent you, Dante, all alone in the garden with the\\nwicked temptress.”\\n\\n“I rather like it. Besides, I know a way out--over there, through my\\nwindow.”\\n\\nAs we strolled across the lawn I asked her, “Where, under the sun, did\\nyou pick up Brookins? He doesn’t seem just your sort.”\\n\\n“I picked him up at Aix-les-Bains. He was sowing his wild oats\\nimaginatively and eyeing the ladies in _La Villa des Fleurs_. He was\\ntrying to find out what it felt like to be truly devilish.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t sound like Brookins. I suppose he was gathering\\nexperience, so that he might be able to deal understanding with erring\\nundergrads.”\\n\\n“You’re charitable. At any rate, when I met him he was playing the\\ntruant from morality. I was in the Casino.”\\n\\n“What doing? Gambling?”\\n\\nShe nodded. “You see I was nearly as bad as Mr. Brookins. He came and\\nstood behind my chair while I was playing. When I got up and went\\nout into the garden, he followed. It was all dusky and dimly lit with\\nfaery-lamps. I suppose it made him feel romantic. I saw what he was\\ndoing out of the corner of my eye; so, for the fun of it, I tried to\\nfascinate him.”\\n\\n“I’ll warrant you did. It was the old game you played with me and the\\nBantam. You take delight in making other people uncomfortable. It’s\\nthe most adventurous thing about you, Fiesole. You’ve got the name of a\\nlullaby and the manners of a mustard-plaster. You’ll be trying to sting\\nme presently, when you catch me sleepy and unaware.”\\n\\n“Not you, Dante.”\\n\\nShe spoke my name coaxingly, veiling her eyes with her long lashes.\\n\\n“But you did once.”\\n\\n“Did I? So you still remember?”\\n\\nI was unwilling to be sentimental. “What did you do next to poor\\nBrookins?”\\n\\nShe took up the thread of her story with feigned demureness. “I chose\\nout a bench well hidden in the shadows. He came and seated himself on\\nthe edge of it, as far away as he could get from me. He cleared his\\nthroat several times. I could hear him moistening his lips. Then\\nhe whispered, almost turning his back on me, ‘Je vous aime.’ And I\\nwhispered, turning my back on him, ‘Do you? Now isn’t that lovely!’”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“Oh, then, finding I was English, he became more comfy. He began to\\nboast about Oxford and mentioned Lazarus. So I thought to-day the least\\nI could do was to call on him. I didn’t know he was a parson. You should\\nhave seen his face when he saw me. I’ve been getting even with him all\\nthis afternoon. He thinks I’ve risen out of the buried past to haunt\\nhim.”\\n\\nShe broke into low musical laughter, shaking her shoulders.\\n\\n“You were cruel, Fiesole. What he said to you was the sum total of the\\nintent of his wickedness. He had reached the limit of his daring.”\\n\\n“I know it. That’s why I don’t like him. He isn’t thorough. He told\\nme that his name was Jordan at Aix. When I asked for him at the lodge\\nto-day, the porter said there weren’t no sich purson. I was turning\\naway, when I saw him coming across quad in full clericals, walking by\\nthe side of a stooping old gentleman shaped like the letter C.”\\n\\n“That would be the Warden.”\\n\\n“Oh, was it? Well, he didn’t see me and was walking right by me. I\\ntapped him on the arm and said, ‘Good-afternoon, Mr. Jordan.’ He paled\\nto his lips and stared. The old gentleman raised his hat to me and said,\\n‘This is Mr. Brookins, not Mr. Jordan, my dear young lady. You must be\\nmistaken.’ ‘Jordan’s my pet name for him,’ I answered. The old gentleman\\nsmiled, and smiled again and left us. Then I turned to Mr. Brookins and\\nsaid, ‘Je vous aime. Be sure your sins will find you out.’ After that I\\ntried to be very nice to him, but somehow I couldn’t make him happy.”\\n\\n“I’m not surprised. Brookins was wondering how he could explain to the\\nWarden not knowing a charming young lady, who had a pet name for him.\\nThey’re asking him about it now at the high-table, and he’s lying fit\\nto shame the devil. His pillow will be drenched to-night with tears\\nof penitence. You rehearsed the Judgment Day to him. You’ve turned the\\ntables on him, because, you know, that’s his profession every Sunday.”\\n\\nI helped her to step across the sill of my window. She gazed round my\\nroom, taking in the pipes and tobacco-ash and clothes strewn about. “I\\nlove it,” she said. “It’s so cosy and mannish.”\\n\\nShe perched herself on the arm of a chair, so that the golden,\\nafter-glow fell athwart her. I watched her, thinking how little she had\\nchanged from the old Fiesole. She was still tantalizing, as mischievous\\nas a school-girl; once she had fiddled with boys’ heartstrings, now she\\ntook her pastime in breaking men’s.\\n\\nShe was a creature of vivid mysteries, alternately wooing and repelling.\\nShe could beckon you on with passionate white arms and thrust you from\\nher with hands of ice. She came out of nowhere like a wild thing from a\\nwood. You looked up and saw her--she vanished. She courted capture and\\ninvited pursuit; but you knew that, though you caught her, you would\\nnever tame her.\\n\\nShe had plucked a deep-cupped daffodil from a vase on the table. She was\\nbending over it with a tender air of contemplation. She held the long\\nslim stalk low down in her dainty, long, slim fingers. The golden dust\\nof the petals seemed the reflection of the golden glint that was in\\nher hair. The stalk was the color of her eyes. Her tempestuous\\nloveliness--made to lure and torture men, to fill them with cravings\\nwhich she could not satisfy--was resting now.\\n\\nShe looked up at me with calculated suddenness. She read admiration in\\nmy eyes.\\n\\n“You find me pretty nice, don’t you, Dante?”\\n\\n“I’m not disguising it, am I?”\\n\\n“I thought, maybe, you were cross with me about Brookins. We never quite\\napproved of one another, did we, Dante? You thought and still think me a\\ncoquette.”\\n\\n“Well, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“With some people, but not with you. I only played with the Bantam to\\ndraw you out of your shell.”\\n\\n“Really?”\\n\\n“Really.”\\n\\nThen the absurdity of being serious over an affair of childhood struck\\nus and we went off into gales of laughter.\\n\\n“Let’s be sensible,” I said. “What are you doing? Staying at Oxford with\\nfriends?”\\n\\n“No. I’m traveling alone with my maid.”\\n\\n“Have you any engagement for this evening?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then why shouldn’t we spend it together?”\\n\\n“No reason in the world.”\\n\\n“Where’ll we spend it?”\\n\\n“Here, if you like.”\\n\\n“But we can’t spend it here, just you and I. The college doesn’t allow\\nit. Besides, you haven’t had dinner. Where’ll we dine?”\\n\\n“Anywhere.”\\n\\n“What do you say to punting down to Sandford and dinner at the inn\\nthere?”\\n\\n“I’m game.”\\n\\nAs we passed through the quads, men were coming out of Hall from dinner.\\nSome of them went thundering up wooden-stairs to their rooms, tearing\\noff their gowns. Others strolled arm-in-arm joking and conversing,\\nsmoking cigarettes. At sight of Fiesole, they hauled up sharply. She was\\na man’s woman, and they were struck by her beauty. With one accord they\\nturned unobstrusively and hurried their steps towards the lodge, to\\ncatch one more glimpse of her face as she passed out. She betrayed no\\nsign that she was aware of the sensation she was creating. She advanced\\nbeside me with eyes modestly lowered, enhancing her allurement with a\\nserene air of innocence. Out in the street her manner changed.\\n\\n“The men do that always,” she said, “and, do you know, I rather like\\nthem for it.”\\n\\n“What do they do?”\\n\\n“Stare after me.”\\n\\n“Don’t wonder Brookins was shocked by you, Fiesole. You’re a very\\nshocking person. You say the most alarming things.”\\n\\nShe laid her hand on my arm for a second. “But I say them charmingly.\\nDon’t I?”\\n\\nOn our way through the meadows to the barges, I asked her what she had\\nbeen doing all these years.\\n\\n“For a time I tried the stage, but lately I’ve been traveling in Europe.\\nI have no relations--nothing to keep me tethered. I roam from place to\\nplace with my maid, moving on and on again.”\\n\\n“Not married?”\\n\\n“I’m not the kind of woman who marries. Men like me, but when it comes\\nto making me their wife, it’s ‘Oh no, thank you.’ They want a woman a\\nlittle more stupid. Are you married?”\\n\\n“Hardly.”\\n\\nShe shot me a penetrating glance. “Engaged?”\\n\\n“Not that I’m aware of.”\\n\\nWe came to the Lazarus barge. I piled cushions in a punt for her. She\\nlay with her back to the prow, so that she faced me. I took the pole and\\npushed off into midstream.\\n\\nWe had the river to ourselves; its restful loneliness caused us to fall\\nsilent. We left the barges quickly; then we drifted slowly. Fields were\\ngrowing white and vaporous. The air was damp, and cool, and earthy.\\nBehind us the spires of Oxford shone like a clump of spears against\\nthe embattled, orange-tinted sky. Before us, swimming in blue haze,\\nwas Iffley Mill. Everything was becoming ill-defined--receding into\\nnothingness. Far away across meadows to the right we caught sounds of\\ngritting hoofs and the grinding of a wagon. Sometimes a bird uttered one\\nlong fluty cry. Sometimes a swallow swooped near us.\\n\\n“Dante, all the others have passed on, and there’s only you and I.\\nWhat’s happened to the Bantam?”\\n\\n“Married in Canada. He’s farming.”\\n\\n“I believe you thought you loved me in the old days.”\\n\\n“I could tell you some things to prove it.”\\n\\n“You didn’t do much to prove it at the time. You were a terribly shy and\\nstubborn boy. You left me to do all the courting. I’ve often laughed at\\nthe things I did to try and make you kiss me.”\\n\\n“And that was what I was wanting most to do all the time. D’you know\\nwhat sent me to the infirmary?”\\n\\nThen I told her how I had crept out of bed and out of doors in the\\nmiddle of the night to visit the summer-house.\\n\\n“What a little beast I was,” she said. “I’m always being a little beast,\\nDante. That’s the way I’m made. Can’t help it. But I’ll never be like\\nthat to you again.”\\n\\nBy the time we got to Sandford it was night. Lamps in the inn were\\nlighted, shining through the trees across the river. We had dinner\\nin the room next to the bar, in an atmosphere of beer and sawdust and\\ntobacco. The windows were open; the singing of water across the weir was\\naccompaniment to our conversation.\\n\\nShe told me the beginning of many things about herself with a strange\\nmixture of frankness and restraint. She spoke of the early days in Italy\\nbefore her parents died, and of the ordered quiet of her convent life\\nat Tours. After her expulsion from the Red House she had returned to\\nFrance, and fallen in with the artistic set that had been her father’s\\nin Paris. Her guardian, an old actor, had persuaded her to train for the\\nstage. For a time she had succeeded, but had dropped her profession to\\ngo traveling.\\n\\n“I’m an amateur at living,” she told me; “I’m always chopping and\\nchanging. I’ll find what I want some day.”\\n\\nHer restlessness had carried her into many strange places. Northern\\nAfrica was known to her; she had been through India and Persia. Speaking\\nin her lazy voice, with the faintest trace of a foreign accent, she\\npainted pictures of sun-baked deserts with caravans of nodding camels;\\nof decayed, oriental cities sprawled out like bleached bones in\\npalm-groves beside some ancient river-bank; of strange fierce rituals in\\nmusty temples, demanding the blood-sacrifice. She made me feel while she\\nspoke how narrowly I had lived my life. Like a fly on a window-pane I\\nhad crawled back and forth, back and forth, viewing the adventure of the\\ngreat outside, rebellious at restraint, but never taking any rational\\nmeasures for escape.\\n\\nThe river droned across the weir. In the bar-room next door glasses\\nclinked; yokels’ voices rose and fell hoarsely in argument. Fiesole came\\nto a halt and leant back in her chair, gazing searchingly into my face\\nacross the table.\\n\\n“You look queer, Dante. What’s the matter?”\\n\\nI laughed shortly. “You’ve been putting the telescope to my eye. You’ve\\nbeen making me see things largely. How was it that you broke loose that\\nway?”\\n\\n“I had a horror of growing stodgy. I was born to be a South Sea Islander\\nand to run about naked in the sunshine.”\\n\\n“How long are you to be in Oxford?”\\n\\n“Don’t know. I’ve made no plans. I hadn’t expected to spend more than\\none night. But now----”\\n\\nShe did not finish the sentence. We rose from the table. In the porch we\\nloitered, breathing in the deep, cool stillness.\\n\\n“You’ll stay a little while, won’t you, Fiesole?”\\n\\nShe took my arm and smiled. “Of course--if you want me.”\\n\\nGoing down through the arbors, we stepped into the punt. The river was\\na-silver with moonlight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI--SPRING WEATHER\\n\\nI drugged myself with Fiesole to avoid thinking of Vi. Fiesole was so\\nvivid in her personality that, while she was present, she absorbed my\\nwhole attention and shut out memory.\\n\\nShe was a continual source of pleasure and surprise, for her mood was\\nforever changing. She could be as naughty as a French novel and as\\nsolemn as the Church of England Prayer Book. When she tried to be\\nboth together she was at her drollest; it was like Handel played on a\\nmouth-organ.\\n\\nShe would never let me take her seriously. There lay the safety of our\\ncomradeship. At the first hint of sentiment, she flew like a hare before\\na greyhound; the way she showed her alarm was by converting what should\\nhave been pathos into absurdity.\\n\\nDay after day of memorable beauty I spent with her in that blowy\\nCotswold country. We would usually appoint our place of meeting\\nsomewhere on the outskirts of Oxford. It was not necessary to let\\neveryone know just how much of our time was lived together. This care\\nfor public opinion lent our actions the zest of indiscretion.\\n\\nAs I set out to meet her, I would pass crowds of undergrads, capped and\\ngowned, sauntering off to their morning lectures. I was playing truant,\\nand that gave an added spice to adventure. Each college doorway frowned\\non my frivolity, calling me back to a sense of duty. But the young\\nfoliage glittered and the spring wind romped down the street, and the\\nshadows quivered and jumped aside as the sunlight splashed them. The\\nlure of the feminine beckoned. Where the houses grew wider apart I would\\nfind her, and we would commence our climb out of the valley. Now we\\nwould come to a farm-house, standing gray and mediaeval in a sea of\\ntossing green. Now we would pass by flowery orchards, smoking with\\nscattered bloom. Brooks tinkled; birds sang; across the hedge a plowman\\ncalled to his horses and started them up a new furrow. And through all\\nthis commotion of new-found life and clamorous hearts we two wandered,\\nglad in one another.\\n\\nOnly the atmosphere of what we talked about remains with me. There were\\nmoments when we skirted the seashore of affection, and perhaps pushed\\nout from land a little way, speculating on love’s audacities and\\ndangers. But these moments were rare, for Fiesole delighted in\\nlove’s pursuit and not in its certainty. We made no pretense that our\\nattraction for one another was more than friendly and temporary. If we\\nplayed occasionally at being lovers, it was understood that we were only\\nplaying.\\n\\nFiesole never admitted that she had prolonged her stay in Oxford for my\\nsake. She kept me in constant attendance by the threat that this might\\nbe my last chance of being with her. The supposition that her visit was\\nshortly to end gave us the excuse we needed for being always together.\\nWe lived the hours which we shared intensely, as friends do who must\\nsoon go their separate ways.\\n\\nBut beneath her veneer of wit and frivolity I began to discover a truer\\nand kinder Fiesole. These flashes of self-revelation came when she was\\noff her guard. They were betrayed by a tremor in her tone or a hesitancy\\nin her gaiety. After a day of exquisite sensations, her independence\\nwould break down and the fear of loneliness would look out from her\\neyes. She would prolong her departure, again postponing it beyond the\\ndate appointed. I began to suspect that her dashing recklessness was\\na barrier of habit, which she had erected to defend her shyness from\\ncurious observers. Insincerity was a cloak for her sincerity. Hidden\\nbehind her tantalizing lightness lay the deep and urgent feminine desire\\nfor a man and little children. I had roused in her the mating instinct.\\nI was not the man; she had yet to find him. With myself the same thing\\nwas true. I took delight in her partly for herself, but mainly as Vi’s\\nproxy. Fiesole and I had come together in a moment of crisis. We saw in\\neach other the shadow of what we desired.\\n\\nWhen a month had gone by I began to debate with myself how far our\\nconduct was safe and justifiable. I went so far as to ask myself the\\nquestion, did I want to marry her. But that consideration was impossible\\nin my state of mind. Besides, as Fiesole herself had said, she was the\\ntype of woman that a man may love and yet fear to marry. She had no\\nsense of moral responsibility. She would demand too much of herself and\\nher lover. Her passion, once aroused, would burn too ardently. It\\nwould be self-consuming. She was a wild thing of the wood, swift and\\nbeautiful, and un-moral.\\n\\nMay had slipped by. June was nearly ended. Still she delayed. A chance\\nremark of Brookins brought me to my senses and forced me to face the\\nimpression we had created. Fiesole, when she visited me in college,\\ninvariably brought her maid; we would shut her up in my bedroom while we\\nsat in my study. In this way, we supposed, appearances had been saved.\\nBut Brookins’s remark proved the contrary--that he hoped I’d let him\\nknow when I moved out of Lazarus as he’d like to have my rooms.\\n\\n“I’m not moving out of Lazarus. What made you think that?”\\n\\n“You’ll have to when you’re married.”\\n\\n“But what makes you think that I’m going to be married?”\\n\\n“We don’t have to think,” he tittered. “We only have to use our eyes.”\\n\\nThat decided me. In common fairness we must separate. Since I could not\\nmake the suggestion to her, I determined to leave Oxford myself. The\\nterm was nearly ended. My work on the Renaissance furnished an excuse\\nfor a visit to Italy. I had never been out of England as yet; at Pope\\nLane we had had all we could do to keep up a plausible appearance of\\nstay-at-home respectability. But Fiesole with her talk of travel, had\\nled me to peep out of the back-door of the world. I made up my mind to\\nstart immediately.\\n\\nIt was a golden summer’s evening. How well I remember it! I had not\\nseen her for two days. I was finishing my packing. A trunk stood in the\\nmiddle of the floor partly filled. Over the backs of chairs clothes hung\\ndisorderly. Piles of books lay muddled about the carpet, among socks and\\nshirts and underwear. Through the open window from the garden drifted in\\nthe rumor of voices and the perfume of roses.\\n\\nThe door opened without warning. I was kneeling beside the trunk.\\nGlancing over my shoulder I saw her. She slipped into the room like a\\nray of sunlight, and stood behind me. She wore a golden dress, gathered\\nin at the waist with a girdle of silver. Her arms, bare from the elbow,\\nhung looped before her with the fingers knotted.\\n\\nI glanced at her a moment. Her face was pale with reproach. Her\\nrebelliousness had departed. Her lips trembled. She looked like a\\nsensitive child, trying not to cry when her feelings had been wounded.\\nThis was the true Fiesole I had long suspected, but had never before\\ndiscovered. We had no use for polite explanations; in the past two\\nmonths we had lived too near together. She knew what it all meant--the\\nhalf-filled trunk, the scattered clothing, the piles of books. Feeling\\nashamed, with a hurried greeting I turned back to my packing.\\n\\n“You’re going.”\\n\\nShe spoke in a low voice, with a tremble in it. It filled me with panic\\ndesire to be kind to her; yet I dared not trust myself. I did not love\\nher. I kept telling myself that I did not love her. My whole mind and\\nbeing were pledged to another woman. And yet pity is so near to love\\nthat I could not allow myself to touch her. I was mad from the restraint\\nI had suffered. To touch her might result in irreparable folly. Kneeling\\nlower over my trunk, I shifted articles hither and thither, pressed them\\ncloser, moved them back to their original places, doing nothing useful,\\nsimply trying to keep my hands busy.\\n\\nShe watched me. I could not see her, but I felt that behind my back the\\nslow, sweet, lazy smile was curling up the corners of her mouth. I knew\\njust how she was looking--how the eyebrows were twitching and nostrils\\npanting, the long white throat was working. I fixed my mind upon Vi. I\\nwas doing this for her. Maybe, if Fiesole had come first, we might have\\nmarried. But we should not have been happy. I must be true to Vi, I told\\nmyself. I was like a man parched with thirst in a burning desert, who\\nsees arise a mirage of green waters and blue palm-trees--and knows it to\\nbe a mirage, and yet is tempted.\\n\\n“You were going away without telling me.”\\n\\nHer voice broke. I listened for the sob, but it did not follow. Outside\\nin the garden a thrush awoke; his notes fell like flashing silver,\\ngleaming dimmer and dimmer as they sank into the silence.\\n\\n“You were going away because of me. I would have gone if you had\\nspoken.”\\n\\nStill kneeling, I looked up at her. “Fiesole, I didn’t dare to tell you.\\nSomething was said. We had to separate. I thought this way was best.”\\n\\n“Said about me?”\\n\\n“About us.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\n“I don’t like to tell you.”\\n\\n“I can guess. They said you were in love with me. Was that it?”\\n\\nI tried to rise, but she held me down with her hands upon my shoulders.\\nEach time I bent back my head to answer, she stooped lower above me. Her\\nbreath was in my hair. The gold flashed up in the depths of her eyes.\\nHer voice broke into slow laughter. With her lips touching my forehead\\nshe whispered, “And what if they did say it?”\\n\\nFor a moment we gazed at one another. I hoped and I dreaded. By one\\nslight action of assent, the quiver of an eye-lid or the raising of a\\nhand, I would thrust Vi from me forever. A marriage with Fiesole would\\nat least be correct--approved by society; but I should have to sin\\nagainst Vi to get it--to sin against a love which was half-sinful.\\n\\nFiesole straightened. The tension relaxed. She placed her hand on my\\nhead, ruffling my hair. As though imitating the thrush, a peal of silver\\nlaughter fell from her lips. “Oh, Dante, Dante! You are just as you\\nwere. You’re still afraid of girls.”\\n\\nI rose to my feet. She was again a coquette, rash, luring attack, but\\nalways on the defensive. I gained control of myself as my pity ebbed.\\nI had been mistaken in thinking I had hurt her. I should have known she\\nwas play-acting. And yet I doubted.\\n\\nWe walked over to the lounge by the window. I seated myself beside her,\\nconfident now of my power to restrain myself. “I was afraid for you--not\\nof you.”\\n\\n“Why should you be afraid for me when I’m not afraid for myself? No,\\nDante, it wasn’t that. You’re afraid of yourself. Someone told you long,\\nlong ago, when you were quite little, that it was naughty to flirt.\\nYou’ve never forgotten it, and each time you begin to feel a bit happy\\nyou believe you’re going to do something bad. So you’ve put your heart\\nto bed, and you’ve locked the door, and you’ve drawn the curtains. You\\nplay nurse to it, and every time it stirs, you tiptoe to the door to see\\nthat the key is turned, and to the windows to see that they’re properly\\nbolted. I’ll tell you what’s the matter with you, Dante. I stole along\\nthe passage and hammered on the door of your heart’s bedroom, and your\\nheart half-roused and called, ‘Nurse.’ There!”\\n\\nShe threw herself back against the cushions, seizing both my hands in\\nhers. She gazed at me unflinchingly, daringly, mockingly. She drew me\\nto her and thrust me from her with quick sharp jerks. She treated the\\nsituation so lightheartedly, so theatrically, that I could have kissed\\nher with impunity. But it would have been like kissing the statue of a\\nwoman. She would have remained unmoved, unresponsive. There would have\\nbeen no adventure of conquest.\\n\\n“No, Miss Impudence,” I said, “you’re wrong. I wish sometimes my heart\\nwere safe in bed. You and I have been good friends. You came to me at a\\ntime when I most needed you. You never guessed the good you were doing.\\nIf this hadn’t happened, I would never have told you. But when I heard\\nsomething said about you, which no girl would like to have said unless\\nit were true, I thought it was time I should be going. You’ve been so\\ngood to me that I couldn’t return your good with evil.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, I daresay I’ve flirted with half-a-hundred men. It’s\\nvery nice of you to think I haven’t, and to be so careful of me. But\\nreally it doesn’t matter what anybody says. I don’t want you to run away\\nbecause of that, just when we were having such a good time together.”\\n\\n“You won’t let me be serious,” I protested. “Now I want you to imagine\\nfor a minute that I’m old, and inoffensive, and have white hair.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, and about seventy.”\\n\\n“About seventy-five I should say--I’ve known some pretty lively men of\\nseventy.”\\n\\n“All right. About seventy-five. I’m imagining.”\\n\\n“My dear girl, you’re twenty-four or thereabouts, and you’re extremely\\nbeautiful. No man can look at you without being fascinated. I’ve often\\nwanted to kiss you myself.”\\n\\n“Then why didn’t you do it?”\\n\\n“Fiesole, you’re not playing the game,” I said sternly. “Please go on\\nimagining.”\\n\\n“I’m imagining.”\\n\\n“As I was saying, you’re extremely fascinating. Everything’s in your\\nfavor for making a happy and successful marriage, except one thing.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“You have no parents. Now parents are a kind of passport. Seeing that\\nyou haven’t any, you’ve got to be more circumspect than other girls. It\\nhas come to my ears that for the past two months you’ve been seen every\\nday with one young gentleman. People are beginning to talk about it.\\nSince you don’t intend to marry him, you ought to drop him until you are\\nmarried.”\\n\\n“Who says I don’t intend to marry him?”\\n\\nShe took me by the shoulders and drew me to her. The afterglow had faded\\nfrom the garden. I could not see her face distinctly, but it seemed to\\nme that that old expression of hungry wistfulness was coming back.\\nI heard men enter the room overhead. A bar of light, like a golden\\nstreamer, fluttered and fell across the lawn. A piano struck up, playing\\n_Mr. Dooley_. The dusk was humanized and robbed of its austerity.\\nHer hands trembled on my shoulders. For a second time I doubted the\\ngenuineness of her playacting. I hurried on.\\n\\n“But if you did want to marry him it would make no difference. He’s\\npledged to another woman.”\\n\\nHer hands fell away. When she spoke it was gravely and with effort. “You\\ndidn’t tell me. You said you weren’t engaged when I asked you.”\\n\\n“Neither am I, nor likely to be.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“She’s married.”\\n\\nThe silence was broken by her taking my hand. She took it with a sudden\\ngesture and, bowing her head, kissed it. “Poor Dante,” she whispered.\\n\\nI rose from the sofa and lit the lamp. Kneeling by my trunk, I\\nblunderingly recommenced my packing. From the window came a muffled,\\nchoking sound. Perhaps she was trying not to sob. I had never seen\\nher so gentle as just now. My mind ran back over the long road we\\nhad traveled. The Fiesole I had seen was a wild, mad girl, provoking,\\ncharming, inconsiderate as a child and frolicsome as the mad spring\\nweather--but rarely tender. I wondered what other secrets of kindness\\nlay hidden in her personality. She was the sort of woman a man might\\nlive with for twenty years and still be discovering. She kept one\\nrestless by the very richness of her character. It was true what she had\\nsaid: many men might love her; few would desire to marry her.\\n\\nShe rose from the lounge. Standing between me and the lamp, her long\\nshadow fell across me. I looked up and saw that her lashes glistened.\\nAgainst the background of the white-paneled room she looked supremely\\nlovely--a tall, gold daffodil. She held her head high on her splendid\\nshoulders with a gesture of proud despair. And yet an appearance of\\nmeekness clothed her. Her face had an expression which a young girl’s\\noften has, but which hers had seldom--an expression which was maternal.\\nShe watched my clumsy attempts to squeeze my clothes into smaller\\ncompass. Then she came and knelt beside me, saying, “Let me do it.”\\n\\nHer swift white hands plied back and forth, re-arranging, smoothing\\nout with deft touches, reaching out for socks to fill the hollows,\\nrectifying my awkwardness. The thought flashed on me that this sensation\\nI had was one of the sacred things of marriage--a man’s dependence on a\\nwoman. As I watched, I imagined the future, if this woman should become\\na wife to me. But the passion for her was not in me. She was only an\\nemotion. The sight of her made me hungrier, but not for her. I reasoned\\nwith myself, saying how many men would desire her. I forced myself to\\nnotice the curve of her neck, the way the red-gold curls clustered about\\nher shell-like ears and broad white forehead. I told myself that the\\nbest solution for Vi would be that I leave her unembarrassed by marrying\\nFiesole. But the more I urged matters, the colder grew my emotions. Then\\nmy emotions ceased and my observations became entirely mental.\\n\\nOverhead, strident and uproarious, as if striving to burlesque what\\nshould have been chivalrous, the piano thumped and banged; men’s voices\\nsmote the night like hammer-strokes on steel, singing,\\n\\n               “Mr. Dooley! Oh, Mr. Dooley!\\n\\n               Mr. Dooley----ooley----ooley----oo.”\\n\\n“It’s done,” she said. Then, “Where are you going?”\\n\\n“To Italy.”\\n\\n“My country. When?”\\n\\n“To-morrow.”\\n\\n“You’ll write me sometimes? I shall be lonely, you know, at first.”\\n\\n“Why, certainly.”\\n\\n“Then, if you’re going to write to me, I must write to you. You’ll have\\nto let me have your addresses so that I can send my letters on ahead.”\\n\\nI wrote her out the list of towns and dates, telling her to address me\\n_poste restante_.\\n\\nI accompanied her across the quad to the lodge. I had had no idea it was\\nso late. Big Tom had ceased ringing for an hour. It was past ten.\\nThe porter, when I called him out to unlock the gate, eyed us\\ndisapprovingly.\\n\\n“I’ll see you home,” I told her.\\n\\nShe hesitated, urged that she could get home quite safely by herself, it\\nwas such a short way to go--but at last she surrendered.\\n\\nThrough the mysterious, moon-washed streets we walked; but not near\\ntogether as formerly. We had nothing to say to one another. Or was\\nit that we had too much, and they were things that we were ashamed to\\nutter? The echo of our footfall followed behind us like a presence. At\\nthe turnings we lost it. Then it seemed to hurry till it had made up the\\ndistance; again it followed. The cobble-stones beneath us made our steps\\nuneven. Sometimes we just brushed shoulders, and started apart with a\\nguilty sense of contact. Sometimes we passed a window that was lighted\\nby a student’s lamp. We could see him through the curtains poring over\\noutspread books, holding his head between his hands. As we turned to\\nlook in on him, our faces were illumined. Her face was troubled; coming\\nout of the night suddenly it looked blanched and distressful.\\n\\nThe air became heavy with the perfume of laburnums. It occurred to me\\nthat the laburnum was the flower with which she was best compared. It\\nburned, and blazed, and fell unwithered. In crossing Magdalene Bridge\\nwe caught the sighing of willows along the banks of the Cherwell. I had\\noften thought how restful was the sound. To-night I marveled at myself;\\nit seemed poignant with anguish, like a fretful heart stirring. Under\\nthe bridge as we crossed, a punt slipped ghostlike down stream; the\\nsubdued laughter of a girl and the muffled pleading of a man’s voice\\nreached us. Then memory assailed me. “They are even as you and I,\\nFiesole,” my heart whispered, “even as you and I once were.”\\n\\nI fell to wondering, as I caught the moon shining through the lace-work\\nparapet of Magdalene tower, how many such love-affairs of lightness it\\nhad seen commenced.\\n\\nAt the door of the house in which she lodged we halted abruptly.\\n\\n“So this is the end,” she said. Then, feigning cheerfulness, she ran up\\nthe steps, crying, “Good luck to you on your journey.”\\n\\nFrom the pavement I called to her, “I’m afraid, I’ve kept you out late,\\nI----”\\n\\nThe door banged.\\n\\nI had had much to say to her. Now that she was gone the thoughts and\\nwords bayed in my brain like bloodhounds. There were apologies, excuses,\\nexplanations--kind, meaningless phrases, which would have held a meaning\\nof comfort for her. It was too late now. For a moment her shadow fell\\nacross the blind; then her arm was raised and the light went out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII--THE BACK-DOOR OF THE WORLD\\n\\nThe Englishman is brought up to live his life independently of woman.\\nHe considers his masculine solitariness a sign of strength. To be seen\\nin the streets with his wife or sisters is to acknowledge that they are\\nnecessary. He feels awkward at being observed publicly in their\\ncompany. He shows them no gallantries. He walks a little way apart. His\\nconversation with them lacks spontaneity. He is not enjoying himself.\\nHe is wanting to be kind and natural, but he dreads lest he should be\\nthought effeminate. His national conception of manliness demands that he\\nshould be complete in himself. How he ever so forgets his shyness as to\\nmake a woman his wife is one of the unsolved mysteries. Some primeval\\ninstinct, deeper than his national training of reserve, goads him to it.\\nOn recovering from his madness, he is among the first to marvel.\\n\\nWhen Christian had climbed to the top of the hill his sack of sins fell\\nfrom his back. When an Englishman lands in France, he drops his bundle\\nof moral scruples in the harbor as he passes down the gang-plank.\\nFor morality is a matter of temperament, and for the time being his\\ntemperament shall be French. Just as a soul newly departed, may look\\nback with pitying resentment on the chill chaotic body that once\\nconfined it, so he looks back across the English Channel at the\\nuncharming rectitude of his former self. Being an Englishman has bored\\nhim.\\n\\nI shall never forget the first wild rapture with which I viewed the tall\\nwhite cliffs of Dieppe. It was about three in the afternoon. The sky was\\nintensely blue, dotted here and there with fleecy islands of cloud. The\\nsun smote down so hotly on the deck that one’s feet felt swollen. Far\\naway the gleaming quaintness of the French fishing-town grew up and\\nstole nearer. It seemed to me that as the wind swept towards us from the\\nland, I caught the merry frou-frou of ten thousand skirts. Fields and\\nwoodlands which topped the cliffs, hid laughing eyes and emotional white\\narms eagerly extended. The staccato chatter of happiness lay before me.\\nI had escaped from the Eveless Paradise of my own countrymen. I had\\nslipped out by the back-door of the world. I was free to act as I liked.\\nI was unobserved. Discretion had lost its most obvious purpose. It\\nexcited me to pretend to myself that I was almost willing to be tempted.\\n\\nThat night I sat by the quays at Rouen, observing the groups of men and\\nwomen, always together, passing up and down. I saw how they drew frankly\\nnear to one another. I listened to their scraps of quiet conversation.\\nThe lazy laughter, now the hoarse brass of men’s voices, now the silver\\nclearness of a woman’s, rose and fell. Below me barges from Paris\\ncreaked against the piles, and the golden Seine swept beneath the\\nbridges, singing like a gay grisette. As night sank down I was stung to\\nloneliness, thinking of the absence of Vi and Fiesole.\\n\\nI arrived in Paris on the evening of the following day. Hastily\\ndepositing my baggage at my hotel in the Rue St. Honoré, I set out to\\nstroll the boulevards. Until three in the morning I wandered from café\\nto café. I searched the faces of passers-by for signs of the gracious\\nabandon to happiness of which I had so often heard. My mind teemed with\\nvivid images of pleasure such as crowd the pages of novels concerning\\nParis. Flitting moth-like up and down garish tunnels of light I saw a\\npainted death. It simpered at me from under shadows of austere churches.\\nIt flirted with me, ogling me with slanted eyes, as I passed beneath the\\nglare of lamps. I crossed the Pont St. Michel going southward, and found\\nit in the guise of girls masquerading in male attire. I went across\\nthe bridges again and found it in the Rue de Rivoli, hunting with jaded\\nfeverish expression for men. Wherever I went I encountered the same\\nfixed mercenary smile, saw the same lavish display of ankles beneath\\nfoamy skirts, and heard the same weary tip-tapping of feet which carried\\nbodies which should be sold to whoever would purchase.\\n\\nWhere was the joy and adventure of which I had heard? The purpose of\\nhappiness should be life, not death. Several times that night women\\nturned aside and seated themselves at a table beside me. They roused my\\npity; pity was quickly changed to disgust by their hot-foot avarice. All\\naround me was a painted death.\\n\\nOverhead the breeze ruffled the tree-tops. I looked up through the\\nleaves. Stars were going out. I caught between roofs of tired houses a\\nglimpse of the Eternal looking down. Surely the God who kept the wind\\ngoing and replenished the sky with clouds, meant man to be happy in\\nsome better fashion. I went back to my hotel and, gathering together my\\nbaggage, fled.\\n\\nAt Florence the problem of right and wrong presented itself to me in\\nanother aspect. Restraint seemed attended with sadness; license with\\nugliness and regret. From above dim shrines disfigured Christs bespoke\\nthe anguish of crucified passions. On the other hand, Filippino’s\\ntattered _Magdalene_ symbolized the hideous rewards of abandonment. Both\\nrestraint and unrestraint brought sorrow, and I wanted to be supremely\\nglad. Life should be an affair of singing. I was fascinated by the\\nthought of woman. With one woman I was in love; in another I was\\ninterested. Both of them I must forget. I would not love Fiesole because\\nI could not marry Vi. Yet within me was this capacity for passion,\\nsmoldering, leaping, expanding, fighting for an outlet. Surely in a\\nrightly governed world it should find some fine expression! Through the\\nby-ways of every city that I entered the lean hound of vice hunted after\\nnightfall, and behind him stalked the painted death. The cleanness of\\nthe country called me. Like a captive stag, I longed to feel the cool\\ntouch of leaves against my shoulders.\\n\\nIn the Accademia at Florence I discovered my own dilemma portrayed. It\\nstated my problem, but it offered no solution. However, it gave me a\\nsense of comradeship to find that Botticelli, so many years ago, had\\npeered down over the same precipice. In _The Kingdom of Venus_ one sees\\na flowered wood; from leafy trees hangs golden fruit; between their\\ntrunks drifts in the flaming light that never was on sea or land. Here a\\nband of maidens have met with a solitary youth to celebrate the renewal\\nof spring. In the center of the landscape, a little back from the group,\\nstands a sad-faced Venus, who might equally well be a madonna listening\\nfor the dreadful beat of Gabriel’s wings who shall summon her to be\\nmother of a saviour to the world. To her left stand three wanton spirits\\nof earth and air, innocently carnal, eternal in their loveliness. To\\nher right three maidens dance with lifted hands. One of them gazes with\\nmelancholy desire towards the youth. He looks away from her unwillingly.\\nIn their eyes broods the gloomy foreknowledge of wrong-doing. They would\\nfain be Grecians, but they have bowed to the Vatican. The shadows, the\\nflowers, the rustling leaves are still pagan; but in the young girl’s\\neyes hangs the memory of the tortured Christ. She is wanton in her\\nscarcely veiled nakedness, but she dares not forget; and while she\\nremembers, she cannot be happy. The lips with which she will woo her\\nlover have worshiped the wound-prints of the pierced hand.\\n\\nThe Renaissance made even its sadness exquisite by using it as the\\nvehicle for poetry; but we, having lost our sense of magic, explain\\nour melancholy in mediaeval terms. Magic was still in the world; I was\\ndetermined to find it.\\n\\nI was continually drawn back to the picture. I would sit before it for\\nhours. It explained nothing. If offered no suggestions. It simply told\\nme what I already knew about myself. But in watching it I found rest.\\nRebellion against social facts which turn love into lust left me. I came\\nto see that a love which is unlawful is only lovely in its unfulfilment.\\nThe young girl in the woodland, did she rouse the frenzy in her lover,\\nwould lose the purity which was irrecoverable; by evening she would weep\\namong the broken flowers. Perhaps, did I win her, it might be so with\\nVi.\\n\\nI tried to find satisfaction by losing myself in memories of the past.\\nThe past is always kindlier than the present because, as Carlyle once\\nsaid, the fear has gone out of it. The heavy actuality of the sorrows of\\nRomeos makes them pleasurable romance only to latter-day observers. In\\ntheir own day they were scandals. So I wandered through sun-scorched\\nItalian towns, red and white and saffron, and I hung above ancient\\nbridges, looking down on rushing mountain torrents, and I dreamt myself\\nback to the glory of the loves that had once been self-consuming beneath\\nthat forgetful hard blue sky.\\n\\nWhen I came to Ferrara my mind was stormy with thoughts of Lucrezia\\nBorgia--Lucrezia of the amber hair. It was here that she came in her\\npageantry of shame to seek her third husband in the unwilling Alphonso.\\nFerrara had not changed since that day. She had seen it as I saw it. I\\nentered the town at sunset. The golden light smote against the red-brick\\nwalls of the Castello. I imagined that I saw her sweet wronged face,\\nhalf-saint, half-siren, gazing out from the narrow barred windows across\\nthe green-scummed moat.\\n\\nI hired rooms in the primitive _Pellegrino e Gaiana_. They looked out on\\nthe dusty tree-shadowed Piazza Torquato Tasso, where tables with white\\ncloths were spread, on which stood tall bottles of rough country wine.\\nI promised myself that from there, as I sat, I could just discern the\\nCastello. I had my dinner beneath the trees. On the further side of the\\nsquare was a wine tavern. Men and girls were singing there. Sometimes\\nthe door would push open, letting out a rush of light. I tried to think\\nthat they were the men-at-arms of long ago. A cool breeze stirred the\\ndust at my feet. The moon was rising. I got up and sauntered through\\ngaunt paved streets, past empty palaces, past Ariosto’s house and out\\ntoward the country, where vines hung heavy with grapes, festooning the\\nolive-trees. Italy lay languorous and scented in the night, like a fair\\ndeep-bosomed courtesan. The sensuous delight of the present mingled with\\nmy thoughts of the past. I had been hardly surprised had Lucrezia stolen\\nout from the dusk towards me, with the breeze whipping about her the\\ngolden snakes of her hair.\\n\\nSlowly I turned back to the town. At the Castello I halted, peering\\nacross the moat at the sullen darkness of the walls on the other side.\\nAs I stood smoking my cigar, I saw an English girl coming towards me\\nacross the Piazza Savonarola. Her nationality was unmistakable; she\\nwalked with a healthy air of self-reliance which you do not find in\\nLatin women. I was surprised to see her. July is not the month for\\ntourists. So far, save for a few Americans, I had had Italy to myself.\\nAnd I was surprised for another reason--she was unaccompanied.\\n\\nAs she drew nearer, I turned my back so that she should not be offended\\nby my staring. I heard her step coming closer. It halted at my side.\\nI looked round, supposing she had lost her direction and was about to\\nquestion me.\\n\\n“You--you here!” I exclaimed and remained staring.\\n\\n“I didn’t think you’d expect me,” she laughed shyly.\\n\\n“Of course I didn’t. How should I? What brought you?”\\n\\n“I was on my way to Venice; but remembering you were here, I stayed over\\nfor the night. You don’t mind?”\\n\\n“Mind! I should say not. Where are you staying?”\\n\\n“At the _Albergo Europa_. I was just on my way over to the _Pellegrino\\ne Gaiana_ to inquire if you were there. I’ve asked at all the other\\nhotels.”\\n\\nWhile we had been speaking I had been watching her closely. What was it\\nthat was changed in her? Was it the voluptuousness of the Italian night\\nthat made her more splendidly feminine? She had lost her laughing tone\\nof laziness. Her beauty was strong wine and fire. Something had become\\nearnest in her. Then I asked myself why had she come--was she really on\\nher way to Venice?\\n\\n“I’m jolly glad you came,” I said impetuously; “I’ve been missing you\\never since I left.”\\n\\n“And I you.”\\n\\nShe took my arm, giving it a friendly hug, just as Ruthita did when she\\nwas glad. We walked over to the Piazza Torquato Tasso. Seating ourselves\\nat a table beneath the trees, we called for wine. The light from the\\ntrattoria fell softly on her face. The air was dreamy with fragrance of\\nlimes. At tables nearby other men and women were sitting. Across the way\\nin the tavern my men-at-arms were still singing and carousing.\\n\\n“What are you thinking?” she asked, leaning across towards me.\\n\\n“I was thinking that I now begin to understand you.”\\n\\n“In what way?” She jerked the question out. It was as though she had\\nflung up her arms to ward off a blow. Her voice panted.\\n\\n“You’ve always puzzled me,” I said. “You are a mixture of ice and fire.\\nThe ice is English and the fire is Italian. You’re different to-night.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“You’re mediaeval. The fire has melted the ice.”\\n\\nShe took my hand gratefully and drew me nearer. “Do you like me better?”\\n\\n“Much better. I keep thinking how like you are to Simonetta in The\\n_Kingdom of Venus_. I spent hours sitting before it at the Accademia in\\nFlorence. I couldn’t tell what was the attraction. Now I know. It was\\nyou I was looking at; you as you are now--not as you were.”\\n\\n“Dante,” she said, “you can see what is beautiful in a painting or\\na poem, but you can’t see beauty in things themselves. You’re afraid\\nto--you’re afraid of being disillusioned. You see life as reflected in a\\nmirror.”\\n\\n“It’s safer,” I smiled.\\n\\nShe took me up sharply. There was pain in what she said. “Ah, yes,\\nsafer! You’re always counting the cost and looking ahead for sorrow.\\nYou’re a pagan, but fear makes you an ascetic. You have the feeling\\nthat joy is something stolen, and you grow timid lest you’re going to be\\nbad.”\\n\\n“That’s true.”\\n\\n“Can’t you believe,” she whispered, “that anything that makes two people\\nhappy must be right and best?”\\n\\n“I wish I could.”\\n\\n“And that anything that makes them sad must be wicked?”\\n\\n“Fiesole,” I said, “have you been sad?”\\n\\nShe would not answer, but drew herself back into the shadow so I could\\nnot see her expression. We sat silent, fingering our glasses, giving\\nourselves over to the languor of the summer’s night. Through the\\nrapturous stillness we heard the breeze from the mountains rustling\\nacross the Emilian plain like a woman in silk attire. At a neighboring\\ntable a man and a girl, thinking themselves unobserved, swayed slowly\\ntowards one another and kissed, as though constrained by some power\\nstronger than themselves. Through the golden windows of the tavern\\nacross the way, one could see the silhouettes of men and women trail\\nstealthily across the white-washed walls. The spirit of Lucrezia and her\\nlover-poets seemed to haunt Ferrara that night.\\n\\n“You’re going to Venice,” I said abruptly. “So am I. Perhaps we shall\\nmeet there.”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“We might travel there together.”\\n\\n“I should be glad.”\\n\\nWe rose from the table. It was late. The piazza was growing empty.\\nThe apple-green shutters before the windows of the houses were closed.\\nBehind some of them were lights which threw gold bars on the pavement.\\nThe streets were silent.\\n\\n“How did you know that I would be here?” I asked.\\n\\n“You forget--you left me your addresses.”\\n\\n“So I did. But you didn’t write. Why didn’t you write?”\\n\\n“I was afraid you wouldn’t understand.”\\n\\nWhat she meant by that I could only guess. Perhaps she hardly knew\\nherself. My blood was rushing wildly through my veins. I was breathing\\nthe atmosphere of passion. I did not look ahead; I was absorbed in the\\npresent. I had been hungry for Vi--well, now I had Fiesole. I had been\\nthirsty for the love of a woman. Fiesole was giving me her comradeship.\\nI was intoxicated with life’s beauty.\\n\\nThe saffron moon looked down, pillowed on a bank of silver cloud. As\\nwe passed the Castello, a fish leapt in the moat, and fell back with a\\nsplash. I halted, leaning against the parapet.\\n\\n“And it was here we met.”\\n\\nShe pressed against me. I could feel the wild beating of her heart;\\nit tapped against my side, calling to my heart for entrance. Her voice\\nshook with emotion; it whispered above the surge of conflicting thoughts\\nlike the solemn tolling of a sunken bell. “Since then everything has\\nbecome golden, somehow.”\\n\\nI dared not trust myself to respond to her tenderness. I was shaken and\\nawed by her intensity. With her lips just a little way from mine, so\\nthat my cheeks were fanned by her breath, her face looked into mine,\\nthe chin tilted and the long white throat stretched back. I gazed on her\\nmotionless, with my arms strained down against my side.\\n\\n“Fiesole,” I whispered, “how many girls and boys have stood here and\\nsaid that!”\\n\\nHer eagerness died out. She slipped her arm into mine. “But we are\\nalive. I was thinking of nobody but our two selves to-night.”\\n\\nWe plunged into the cool deep shadows of the colonnade. We turned into\\nthe Corso della Giovecca. Down the long dim street all the houses stood\\nin darkness, save for a faint patch of light which carpeted the pavement\\nin front of her hotel.\\n\\n“Your maid will be wondering what has happened.”\\n\\nShe looked at me curiously. “She won’t. I didn’t bring her.”\\n\\n“Good-night until to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Good-night.”\\n\\nShe looked back once from the doorway and smiled. She entered. The sleepy\\nporter came out and swung to the gates.\\n\\nI was amazed at her bewitching indiscretion. For myself it did not\\nmatter. But what of her, if we should be seen together? A man can afford\\nsuch accidents; but a woman---- I tried to deceive myself. Our meeting\\nwas, as she had said, haphazard. We were both alone in Italy. Our routes\\nlay in the same direction. What more natural than that we should travel\\ntogether? But I knew that this was not the case. I determined to open\\nher eyes to the risks she was taking.\\n\\nNext morning when I woke, I wondered vaguely what was the cause of this\\nstrange elation. Then memory came back. I jumped out of bed and flung\\nthe shutters wide. Out in the piazza some earlier risers were already\\nseated at the tables. A man was watering the pavement, singing gaily to\\nhimself. Beneath the trees a parrot and a cockatoo screeched, hurling\\ninsults at one another from their perches. A soldier showed his teeth\\nand laughed, talking to a broad-hipped peasant girl. At the top of the\\npiazza a slim white figure waited.\\n\\nI made haste with my dressing. I was extremely happy. I tried to analyze\\nthe situation, but lost patience with myself.\\n\\nPicking up my hat and running down the stairs, I came across her\\nstanding outside the Cathedral, in the full glare of the sun. Before I\\nhad spoken she turned, darting like a pigeon, instinctively aware of my\\napproach. “I’ve beaten you by nearly two hours,” she called gaily.\\n\\nWe passed into the fruit-market. I bought a basket of ripe figs; sitting\\ndown on a bench we ate them together. All round us was stir and bustle.\\nFarmers in their broad straw-hats were unyoking oxen while women spread\\nthe wares.\\n\\n“Fiesole, there’s just one thing I want to say to you, after which I’ll\\nnever mention it.”\\n\\n“I know what it is. I’ve thought it all out.”\\n\\n“Are you sure you have? Of course no one may ever know. But if by some\\nchance they should find out, are you sure that you think it’s worth\\nwhile?”\\n\\n“Reckoning the cost again!” she laughed, helping herself to another fig.\\n\\n“I’ll pay gladly. It’s you I’m considering,” I said seriously.\\n\\nShe rested her hand on mine. It was cool, and long, and delicate. I was\\nstartled at the thrill it gave me. “Dante,” she whispered, “have you\\never wanted anything so badly that your whole body ached to get it? When\\nyou were very thirsty, say, and you heard a stream, singing ‘Find me.\\nFind me’ out of sight in the hills among the heather? Then you climbed\\nup and up, and the sun beat down, and your throat was dry, and the\\nstream sang louder, and at last you found it. I’m like that. I don’t\\nmind what the bank is like. I lie down full-length and let the water\\nsing against my mouth. I’ve been thirsty for something, Dante, all my\\nlife. Yes, I’ve counted the price. If you don’t mind having me, Dannie,\\nI’ll stay with you for the present.”\\n\\nShe rubbed her cheek against my shoulder ever so slightly. I bent\\ntowards her. When you’ve wounded a woman, there’s only one way of making\\nrecompense. She saw my intent. She drew back laughing, dragging my hand\\nwith her. The quick red blood mounted to her forehead. The gold in her\\ngreen eyes sparkled with gladness. “Not now,” she cried. Then recovering\\nherself, “But you’re a dear to want me like that.”\\n\\nThat morning we visited the Corpus Domini where Lucrezia Borgia lies\\nburied. We were admitted to a little chapel where all was lonely and\\nsilent. Presently a door opened and two nuns dressed in black entered.\\nTheir faces were covered from sight by long black veils. All that was\\nhuman we were permitted to see of them was their eyes, which looked\\nout from two black holes like stars in a dreary night. They had been\\nbeautiful perhaps, but because Christ was crucified they had crucified\\nthemselves. And these women, who had never tasted life, whose flesh\\nhad never throbbed with the sweet torture which was their right, whose\\nbodies were the unremembered sepulchres of little children whose lips\\nhad never pressed the breast--these women were the guardians of her who\\nhad been the Magdalene of the Renaissance, whose feet had climbed\\nthe Calvary of passion, but not the Calvary of sacrifice. Sunlight,\\namber- as Lucrezia’s hair, slipped across the slab which marked\\nher grave. Down there in the unbroken dusk, did her tresses mock decay?\\n\\nFrom a hidden cloister the chanting of children’s voices broke the\\nquiet. Its very suddenness took me by the throat. It was the future\\ncalling out of the sad and moldering content of stupidly misspent\\nlives. Fiesole edged her hand into mine. I smiled into her eyes; then I\\nlooked at the nuns again. Who would remember them when three centuries\\nhad gone by? Lucrezia, if she had been wanton, had at least given joy;\\nso the world forgave her now that she was buried. We tiptoed out into\\nthe tawny street, where water tinkled down the gutters. We had found a\\nnew sanction for desire.\\n\\nIt was towards evening that we sighted Venice, floating between sea and\\nsky in a tepid light. Where we parted from the mainland, thin trees ran\\ndown to the water’s edge, shivering and gleaming, like naked boys. As\\nthe train thundered across the trestled bridge which spans the lagoon,\\nFiesole and I crowded against the window, tingling with excitement. The\\nsalt wind smote upon our faces and loosened a strand of her red-brown\\nhair. Laughing, I fastened it into place. She snatched up my hand\\nand kissed the fingers separately. We were children, so thrilled with\\nhappiness that we could speak only by signs and exclamations. A gondola\\ndrifted by, rowed by a poppe in a scarlet sash. Though we both saw it,\\nwe cried to one another that it was a gondola, and waved. Then the gold\\nsun fell splashing through the clouds; Venice was stained to orange, and\\nthe lagoon to the purple of wine.\\n\\nNot until the train had halted in the station did it occur to me that we\\nhad made no plans.\\n\\nHotel porters were already fighting to get possession of our baggage.\\n\\n“Where are you going to stay?” I asked.\\n\\n“Wherever you like,” she said. “A good place is the _Hotel D’Angleterre_\\non the Riva degli Schiavoni.”\\n\\nSo she took it for granted that we should put up at the same hotel! We\\nwent aboard the steamer and traveled down the Grand Canal in prosaic\\nfashion, with the nodding black swans of gondolas all about us.\\n\\nThe _Hotel D’Angleterre_ stands facing the Canale di San Marco, looking\\nacross to San Maria della Salute. The angle is that from which so many\\nof Canaletto’s Venetian masterpieces were painted.\\n\\nThe proprietor came out to greet us suave and smiling. “A room for\\nMonsieur and Madame?”\\n\\n“Two rooms,” I said shortly.\\n\\nWhen we went upstairs to look at them, we found that they were next door\\nto one another. Fiesole made no objection.\\n\\nThey were both front rooms and faced the Canal. One could hardly find\\nfault with them on the ground that they were too near together.\\n\\nBy the time dinner was over the silver dusk was falling. A hundred\\nyards out two barche, a little distance separated, drifted with swinging\\nlanterns. The tinkling of guitars sounded and the impassioned singing of\\na girl. Above embattled roofs of palaces to the westward fiery panthers\\nof the sunset crouched. The beauty of it all was stinging--it seemed\\nthe misty fabric of a dream which must instantly shatter and fade into a\\npale and torturing remembrance.\\n\\nWe stepped into a gondola.\\n\\nShe spoke a few hasty words in Italian, then we stole out from the quay\\nacross the velvet blackness.\\n\\n“Where are we going?” I asked her.\\n\\n“Round the old canals of the Rialto.”\\n\\nSoon every sound, even the faint sounds of Venice, grew fainter and\\nvanished. Only the dip of the oar was heard, the water lapping, and the\\nweird plaintive cry of the poppe as we approached a corner, “A-òel,” and\\n“Sia stali” or “Sia premi” as we turned. We crept along old waterways\\nwhere the oozy walls ground against the gondola on either side. Far, far\\nup the narrow ribbon of ink-blue sky and the twinkling of stars looked\\ndown. Fiesole cuddled against me, like a contented tired child. I kept\\nthinking of what she had said, “Have you ever wanted anything so badly\\nthat your whole body ached to get it?” I wondered if she had got that\\nsomething now.\\n\\nWhen we returned to the hotel it was past midnight. The sharp tang of\\nmorning was in the air. Lights which had blazed across the lagoon,\\nnow smoldered like torches burnt to the socket. Venice floated, a fair\\nOphelia with eyes drowned and hair disordered; one saw her mistily as\\nthrough water.\\n\\nOur gondola creaked against the landing, banged by the little waves.\\nA poppe in a nearby barca groaned in his sleep and stirred. We were\\ncramped with our long sitting. I gave Fiesole my arm; she shrank against\\nme. At the door of her room I paused.\\n\\n“We’ve had one brilliant day to remember. You’re happy now?”\\n\\n“Very happy, dear Dante.”\\n\\nI entered my room and sat down in the dark on the side of the bed.\\n\\nI did not love her. I blundered my way over all the old arguments. I\\ntold myself that, since I could not marry Vi, I could not do better than\\nmarry Fiesole. But at the thought my soul rebelled--it was treachery. I\\ntried to expel Vi’s image from my mind, but it refused to be expelled. I\\nlived over again all the intoxicating pleasure of the day, but it was Vi\\nwho was my companion. I only drugged myself with Fiesole. She appealed\\nto my imagination; her loveliness went like a strong wine to my head.\\n\\nIn the next room all sounds of stirring had ceased. I looked up;\\ngreyhound clouds, long and lean, coursed in pursuit of stars across the\\nmoon. I tiptoed to the window. As I leant out, I heard a faint sighing.\\nI caught the glint of copper-gold hair poured across the sill of the\\nneighboring window. Fearing she might see me, I drew back. Why was it,\\nI asked myself, that Fiesole was not my woman? What was the reason for\\nthis fantastic loyalty to Vi, who could never be mine? Was it instinct\\nthat held me back from Fiesole or mere cold-heartedness?\\n\\nFor the next three days we wandered Venice, doing the usual round of\\nchurches and palaces. I was feverishly careful to live my life with\\nFiesole in public. I feared for her sake to be left alone with her.\\nThere was protection in spectators. She understood and accepted the\\nsituation, though we had not discussed it together. She played the part\\nof a daring boy, carrying herself with merry independence. At times I\\nalmost forgot she was a girl. She disarmed my watchfulness, and seemed\\nbent on showing me that it was unnecessary.\\n\\nOn the morning of the fourth day, we returned to déjeuner parched\\nand footsore from exploring the stifling alleys which lie back of the\\nRialto. The air was heavy and sultry. The water seemed to boil in the\\ncanals. Every stone flung back the steady glare. Blue lagoons, polished\\nas reflectors, mirrored the blue of the cloudless sky.\\n\\nFrom where we sat at table, we could see crowded steamers draw in at the\\npier and crawl like flies across the bay to Lido.\\n\\nFiesole made a queer little face at me. “Stupid old sober-sides!”\\n\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n\\nShe flung herself back in her chair, regarding me with a languid,\\narch expression. “I’m tired of fudging in and out of old palaces and\\nchurches. I came here to enjoy myself. If I promise to be a good girl,\\nwill you take me to Lido to bathe? We’ll have one dear little afternoon\\nall to ourselves.”\\n\\nA warm breeze caught us on the steamer. What ripe lips Fiesole had, and\\nwhat inscrutable eyes! Since that first night of our arrival, she had\\nprevented me from treating her with any of the privileges of her sex.\\nShe had walked when and where she liked. She had insisted on paying her\\nshare of everything down to the last centesimi. Now she changed her mood\\nand slipped her arm through mine. We had both grown tired of pretending\\nshe was a man. “You needn’t be afraid to be nice to me,” she said.\\n\\nThere were lovers all about us: girls from the glass-factories in\\nwhite dresses, bareheaded, with tasseled black shawls; sailors from the\\nArsenal with keen bronzed faces and silky mustaches. Venice was taking\\na day off and giving us a lesson in happiness. The self-consciousness\\nof the Anglo-Saxon, which makes the expression of pleasure bad taste\\nand distressing, was absent. Each was occupied with him or herself,\\nsublimely unconscious of spectators.\\n\\n“Haven’t I been nice?”\\n\\nShe patted my hand, entirely the woman now. “You’ve been trying to be\\ncorrect. Why can’t you be your own dear self?”\\n\\nTaking the tram across the island, we came to the Stabilimento dei\\nBagni. We walked through the arcade and down on to the terrace. The sea\\nrolled in flashing, green and silver, in a long slow swell. Leaning over\\nthe side, we watched the bathers. Men, with costumes unfastened at the\\nshoulders, sifted golden sand through their fingers on to their\\nnaked chests. Women lay beside them, buried in the sand, laughing and\\nchatting.\\n\\nI noticed a blond young giant standing at the water’s edge. His face\\nkindled. I followed the direction in which he was looking. A dark-eyed\\ngirl had come out of her cabin. She wore a single-piece, tight-fitting\\nsuit of stockingette, which displayed her figure in all its splendid\\ncurves. Her face was roguish and vivid as that of Carmen. On her head\\nshe wore a scarlet turban. Her costume was sky blue.\\n\\nThe men who had been lying on their backs, turned over and regarded her\\nwith lazy admiration of her physical loveliness. Seemingly unaware of\\nthe interest she aroused, she came tripping daintily to the water’s\\nedge, her white limbs flashing. The man held out his hand. With little\\nbirdlike exclamations she ran to him; then drew back and shivered as\\nthe first wave rippled about her feet. He encouraged her with tender,\\nquickly spoken words. Her timidity was all a pretty pretense and they\\nboth knew it; but it gave them a chance to be charming to one another.\\nHe seized her hand again; she hung back from him laughing. Then they\\nwaded out together, hand-in-hand, splashing up diamonds as they\\nwent. They seemed to see no one but each other; they eyed one another\\ninnocently, unabashed. When they came to the deeper water, she clasped\\nher arms about his neck; he swam out toward the horizon with her riding\\non his back. He was like a young sea-god capturing a land-maiden.\\n\\nA stab of envy shot through me. I felt indignant with my inherited\\npuritanism. It would not permit me simply to enjoy myself. I must be\\nforever analyzing motives, and lifting the lid off the future to search\\nfor consequences.\\n\\nI looked at Fiesole. Her eyes were starry. They seemed to mock me and\\nplead with me saying, “Oh, Dannie, why can’t we be like that?”\\n\\nI glanced down at the beach. The bathers were rising up and shaking off\\nthe sand. I noticed that only the women who had no beauty hid themselves\\nbehind bathing-skirts. The Italian standard of modesty!--you only need\\nbe modest when you have something to be ashamed of. I accepted the\\nstandard.\\n\\nFiesole broke the silence, clapping her hands, crying “Wasn’t she\\nperfect!” Then she took hold of my face in childish excitement and\\nturned my head. “Oh, look there!”\\n\\nAn English girl had come out. Her bathing-suit was drab- and\\nbaggy. Sagging about her knees hung an ugly skirt. In her clothes she\\nmight have been pretty; but now she was awkward and embarrassed. Her\\nmanner called attention to the fact that she was more sparsely clad than\\nusual. She wore tight round her forehead a wretched waterproof cap.\\n\\n“There’s Miss England,” laughed Fiesole.\\n\\n“When we bathe, you be Miss Italy,” I laughed back.\\n\\nAnd she was.\\n\\nWhen I look back to that sunny July afternoon with the blue and silver\\nAdriatic singing against the lips of the land, the warm wind blowing\\ntoward the shore from Egypt’s way, the daring flashing of slim white\\nbodies tossed high by glistening waves, and the undercurrent merriment\\nof laughter and secret love-making, I know that I had ventured as far as\\nis safe into the garden which knows no barriers. It is as I saw her then\\nthat I like to remember Fiesole. I can see her coming down the golden\\nsands, with a tress of her gold-red hair, that had escaped, lying\\nshining between her breasts. I recall her astonishing girlishness, which\\nshe had hidden from me so long. Like a wild thing of the woods, she came\\nto me at last, timid in her daring, halting to glance back at the green\\ncovert, advancing again with glad shy gestures. Whatever had gone before\\nwas gallant make-belief. Without a word spoken, as her eyes met mine she\\ntold me all at the water’s edge.\\n\\nThat afternoon I learnt the absurd delirium that may overtake a man who\\nis owned in public by a pretty woman. She was the prettiest woman in\\nItaly that day from her small pink feet to her golden crown. And she\\nknew it. She treated me as though I was hers and, forgetting everything,\\nI was glad of it. I can still thrill with the boyish pride I felt when\\nI fastened her dress, with all the beach watching. Whatever she asked\\nme to do was a delightful form of flattery. It pleased me to know that\\nothers were suffering the same pangs of envy that I had felt. They were\\nsaying to themselves, “How charming she is! What a lucky fellow! That’s\\nwhat youth can do for you. I wonder whether they’re married.”\\n\\nTucking her arm under mine with a delicious sense of proprietorship, we\\nset out with the crowd through the tropic growth of flowers to the pier\\nfrom where the steamer started. A little way ahead I saw the blond giant\\nwith his gay little sweetheart. He was all care of her. She fluttered\\nabout him like a blue butterfly about a tall sunflower. She looked\\nup into his face, making impertinent grimaces. He nodded his head and\\nlaughed down.\\n\\nWas it only the spirit of imitation that caused us to copy them? They\\ngave us a glimpse into the tender lovers’ world, which we both were sick\\nwith longing to enter. If Fiesole was playing a part she played it well.\\nHer cheeks flushed and her eyes were brilliant. She made me feel the\\nsame bewilderment of gladness I had felt all those years ago, as a boy\\nat the Red House. How much it would have meant to me then if she had\\ntreated me as she did now!\\n\\nWe crossed the bay towards the hour of sunset. Venice swooned in a\\ngolden haze. Clouds struck sparks from the burning disk, like hammers\\nfalling on a glowing anvil. The lagoon stared at the sky without a\\nquiver. We traveled a pathway of molten fire.\\n\\n“We must live this day out,” I said as we landed. “Let’s go to the\\nBauer-Grunwald to-night.”\\n\\nWe hurried upstairs and changed into evening-dress. I tapped at her\\ndoor, asking, “Are you ready?”\\n\\n“All except some hooks and eyes. Come in,” she replied.\\n\\nShe was seated before the looking-glass, with her arms curved upward,\\ntucking a bow of black ribbon in her hair. It was her reflection that\\nlooked into my face and smiled.\\n\\n“You do me proud, Fiesole,” I said, remembering one of Vi’s phrases.\\n\\nShe looked as simple as a sixteen year old girl. Her dress was of pale\\ngreen satin, cut high in the waist in Empire fashion, hanging without\\nfullness to just above her ankles. The sleeves left off at the elbows.\\nHer wonderful russet hair was gathered into a loose knot and lay coiled\\nalong her neck. She was the Fiesole of my school-days. Had she intended\\nto remind me?\\n\\nI sat down on the edge of the bed while she finished her dressing,\\nfollowing with my eyes the feminine nick-nacks which were strewn about.\\nBut always my eyes came back to her, with the mellow glory from the\\nwindow transfiguring her face and neck. There was a nipping sweetness in\\nbeing so near to a woman whom I could not hope to possess. I knew that\\nwithout marrying her I could not keep her. Platonic friendships are only\\nsafe between men and women whose youth is withered. I was wise enough\\nto know that. We were chance-met travelers in Lovers’ Land--truants who\\nwould soon be dragged back. I kept saying to myself, “Intimacy such as\\nwe have can go but a short way further; any hour all this may end.”\\n\\nThen I tried to imagine how this evening would seem to me years hence.\\nThe poignancy of life’s changefulness made me wistful. One day we should\\nboth be old. We should be free from tempestuous desires. The generous\\nfires of youth would have burnt out. We should know the worth then of\\nthe pleasures we now withheld from one another. We should meet,\\nhaving grown commonsense or satiated, and would wonder wherein lay the\\nmastering attraction we had felt--from what source we had stolen our\\nromance. We should be weary then, walking where our feet now ran. Why\\ncould we not last out this moment forever?\\n\\nShe rose, shaking down her skirt and courting my admiration.\\n\\n“You may get to work on the hooks and eyes, old boy.”\\n\\nHer voice was jerky with excitement. My fingers were awkward with\\ntrembling. As I leant over her, she patted my cheek, flashing a caress\\nwith her eyes. “Do you know, you’re handsome, Dante?”\\n\\nI wanted to crush her in my arms, but my habitual restraint prevented. I\\nshould destroy the virginal quality in her--something which could never\\nbe put back. My mind conjured the scene. I saw her folded against me,\\nher eyes brimming up to mine in tender amazement. But my arms went on\\nwith their business, as though some strong power held them down.\\n\\n“It’s done. Come, bambino, it’s getting late.”\\n\\nShe followed me down the stairs. My senses were reeling with the\\nmaddening fragrance of her presence. We walked through the Piazzetta and\\nPiazza di San Marco, through the narrow streets and across the bridges\\ntill we arrived at the garden beside the canal. Arbors were illumined\\nwith faery-lamps. It seemed a scene staged for a theatre rather than\\na living actuality. Gondolas stole past the garden through the dusk.\\nMysterious people alighted. Guitars tinkled. In tall mediaeval houses\\nrising opposite, lamps flashed and women looked down. As specters in\\na dream, people leant above the bridge, gazed into the water, and\\nvanished. Venice walked with slippered feet and finger to lips that\\nnight.\\n\\nThe silence shivered; a clear peal of laughter rippled on the air. We\\nturned. The girl with the young sea-god was entering the garden. They\\nseated themselves at a table near us--so near that we could watch their\\nexpressions and overhear much that was said. It seemed they were fated\\nto goad us on and make us ambitious of attaining their happiness.\\n\\nFiesole stretched out her hands. I smiled and took them, holding them\\npalms up. “They’re like petals of pink roses,” I said.\\n\\nHer face was laughing. “Do you think I’m pretty?”\\n\\n“I’ve always thought that, and you know it--ever since you wouldn’t kiss\\nme in Sneard’s garden.”\\n\\n“It was you who wouldn’t ask to be kissed,” she pouted. “What you could\\nhave, you didn’t value. It’s the same now.”\\n\\nHer hands quivered; her lips became piteous. All the wild commotion\\nof her heart seemed to travel through them to myself. My throat became\\nsuddenly parched.\\n\\n“You know how it is, Fiesole. It isn’t that I haven’t affection for you;\\nbut to do that kind of thing, if I don’t intend to make you more to me,\\nwouldn’t be fair.”\\n\\n“But if I want it? What if I were to tell you, Dante, that you’re the\\nonly man I’ve ever cared for? What if I were to tell you that you’ve\\nalways been first in my heart, ever since we first met?”\\n\\nI looked away from her to the street of water. I had nothing with which\\nto answer. She tried to drag her hands from me, but still I held them.\\n\\n“Dante,” she whispered, “look at me.” Her voice grew fainter. “I’m not\\nspeaking of marriage. Two people can be kind to one another without\\nthat.”\\n\\n“And have I been unkind?”\\n\\nShe turned from my question. “You can never marry her,” she said. “You\\nknow that.”\\n\\nA long silence elapsed, which was broken by voices of the girl and\\nher lover at the neighboring table. Fiesole spoke again. “They’re not\\nmarried. They never will be married. And yet they can share with one\\nanother one little corner of their lives.”\\n\\n“For me it’s all or nothing,” I said. “If it wasn’t all, I should be\\nforever thinking of the end. That’s how I’m made--it’s my training. If I\\ndid anything to you, Fiesole, that wounded you ever so little, I should\\nhate myself. Wherever you were, I should be thinking of you--wanting\\nto leave everything to come to you. I can’t forget. My conscience would\\ngive me no rest.”\\n\\nShe drew her hands free. “And yet you’re wounding me now.”\\n\\nShe was always different from other women, doing the unexpected. Instead\\nof sitting melancholy through dinner, she broke into a burst of high\\nspirits. She told me about her father, who had marched with Garibaldi.\\nShe rallied me on the awkward little boy I had been when first we\\nmet--all arms, and legs, and shyness. She talked of love in a bantering\\nfashion, as insanity of the will. One minute she was the cynical woman\\nof the world--the next the innocent young school-girl. She puzzled\\nand played with me. Then she fell back into the vein of tenderness,\\nrecalling the good times we had had, stampeding through the Cotswolds in\\nspringtime with the mad wind blowing.\\n\\nIt was nearing midnight when we rose. Going down the little garden, we\\nhalted on the steps by the canal. A dozen shadowy figures leapt up\\nwith hoarse cries. We beckoned to a poppe; the gondola stole up and we\\nentered.\\n\\n“Don’t go back yet,” Fiesole pleaded.\\n\\nWe crept through ancient waterways, all solitary and silent; past\\nchurches blanched in the moonlight, and empty piazzas; under bridges\\nfrom which some solitary figure leant to observe us. Now a swiftly\\nmoving barca would overtake us; as it fled by we had a glimpse through\\nthe curtains of a man and a woman sitting close together. Now the door\\nof a tavern would suddenly open, flinging across the water a bar of\\ngarish light; cloaked figures would emerge and the door would close as\\nsuddenly as it had opened. Overhead in balconies we sometimes detected\\nthe stir of life where we had thought there was emptiness, and would\\ncatch the rustle of a woman’s dress or see the red flare of a cigarette.\\nWe had the haunted sensation one has in a wood in May-time: though he\\ndiscerns but little with the eye, he is conscious that behind green\\nleaves an anonymous, teeming world is mating and providing for its\\nmomentous cares.\\n\\nFiesole pressed against me; the darkness seemed to fling out hands,\\nthrusting us together. She slipped off her hood and pushed back her\\ncloak, displaying her arms and throat and hair. The seduction of her\\nbeauty enthralled and held me spellbound. The air pulsated with illicit\\ninfluences. The dreaming city, vague and labyrinthine, was the outward\\nsymbol of my state of mind. I had lost my standards; my will-power\\nwas too inert to rouse itself for their recovery. I was entranced by\\na sensuous inner vision of loveliness which exhausted my faculties of\\nresistance. I apprehended some fresh allurement of femininity through\\neach portal of sense. Fiesole’s touch made my flesh burn; her eyes stung\\nme to pity; her voice caressed me. Her body relaxed till it rested the\\nlength of mine. Her head lay against my shoulder; her arms were warm\\nabout my neck. I tried to think--to think of honor and duty; but I could\\nonly think of her.\\n\\n“You know what you said about Simonetta,” she whispered; “how you\\nthought I was like her and you spent hours before _The Kingdom of\\nVenus_. You were wrong, all wrong, Dante, in your thoughts about her.\\nThe young man in the picture was Giuliano dei Medici and Simonetta\\nwas dear to him for many years. So the flowers weren’t broken, Dannie.\\nInstead of broken flowers, they made poetry for Botticelli to paint.”\\n\\nHow could I tell her that there was a difference between love and\\npassion?--that my feeling for her could be only passion, because my\\nlove was with Vi? She loved me--that made all her actions pure. Morality\\nwould sound like the rasping voice of a tired schoolmaster, scolding a\\nclassroom of healthy boys. It was even unsafe for me to pity her; when\\nI drew my coat about her, she kissed my hand. I clasped her closely,\\ngazing straight ahead, not daring to look down. Every quiver of her\\nlanguorous body communicated itself.\\n\\n“Fiesole, if I don’t marry her, I will marry you some day. I promise.”\\n\\n“But I want you now--now--now.” Her whisper was sharp-edged with\\nlonging; it beat me down and ran out among the shadows like a darting\\nblade.\\n\\nWe floated under the Bridge of Sighs and drew up at the landing. She\\nleant heavily on my arm. We walked along the quay in silence. Few people\\nwere about. I saw mistily; my eyes were burning as if they had gazed\\ntoo long into a glowing furnace. She drooped against me like a crushed\\nflower.\\n\\n“You’re breaking my heart, Fiesole. I’d give you anything, but the thing\\nthat would hurt you. Let me have time to consider.”\\n\\nI was saying to myself, “Perhaps it would be right to marry her.” But\\nthe memory of her whisper clamored insistently in my ears and prevented\\nme from thinking, “_I want you now--now--now._” With her voice she made\\nno reply.\\n\\nWe entered the hotel and stole past the office; the porter was sleeping\\nwith his head bowed across his arms. On the dimly lit stairs she dragged\\non my arm, so that I halted. Suddenly she freed herself and broke from\\nme, running on ahead.\\n\\nStanding still, almost hiding from her, I listened for her door to open\\nand shut. Nothing stirred. I crept along the naked passage and found her\\nleaning against the wall outside our rooms. Her head was thrown back\\nin weariness, not in defiance; her arms were spread out helplessly; her\\nhands, with palms inward, wandered blindly over the wall’s surface. She\\nwas panting like a hunted fawn. Her knees shook under her. Her attitude\\nwas horribly that of one who had been crucified.\\n\\nMade reckless by remorse, I bent over her and kissed her. Because I did\\nnot put my arms about her, she made no response.\\n\\nSomething happened, wholly inexplicable, as though we had been joined by\\na third presence. Not a stair creaked. Everyone was in bed. The air\\nwas flooded with the slow, sweet smell of violets. I became aware of a\\npalpitating sense of moral danger.\\n\\nI drew back from Fiesole. Her physical fascination faded from me; yet I\\nhad never felt more tender towards her.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, dear,” I said.\\n\\nShe met my gaze with a frozen, focusless expression of despair. Her\\nhands ceased their wandering.\\n\\nI entered my room and, closing the door, stood pressed against the\\npanel, listening. After what seemed an interminable silence, her door\\nopened and shut. I looked out into the passage; it was empty.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nI spent a sleepless night and rose with my mind made up; since she\\nwanted it I would marry her.\\n\\nGoing downstairs, I found she had not breakfasted. As a rule she was an\\nearlier riser than myself; usually I found her waiting for me. I went\\nfor a stroll on the Piazzetta to give her time. On my return she had not\\nappeared. I was beginning to grow nervous; then it occurred to me that\\nshe was postponing the first awkwardness of meeting me by breakfasting\\nin bed.\\n\\nTaking my place at our table in the window, I told the waiter to carry\\nFiesole’s rolls and coffee up to her bedroom. He looked a trifle blank,\\nand hurried away without explanation. He returned, followed by the\\nproprietor, who informed me with much secret amusement that the signora\\nhad called for her bill at seven o’clock that morning and had departed,\\ntaking her baggage. I inquired if she had left any message for me; the\\nproprietor stifled a laugh and shook his head. I immediately looked up\\ntrains, to discover which one she had intended catching. There was one\\nwhich had left Venice at eight for Milan. At the station I found that a\\nlady resembling Fiesole had taken a ticket for the through-journey. By\\nthis time it was ten; the next train did not leave till two o’clock. I\\nsent a telegram to catch her at Brescia, to be delivered to her in\\nthe carriage. No reply had been returned by the time I left Venice. I\\nreached Milan in the evening and pursued my inquiries till midnight, but\\ncould get no trace of her. Either I had been mistaken in her direction,\\nor she had alighted at one of the intermediate stations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII--THE TURNING POINT\\n\\nBefore my experience at Venice the world had consisted for me of Vi,\\nmyself, and other people; now it was only myself and Vi. I spent my days\\nin shadowy unreality; just as a child, waking from a bad dream, sees\\none face he can trust gazing over the brink of his horror, so out of the\\nblurred confusion of my present I saw the face of Vi.\\n\\nFiesole had not shown me love in its purity, but she certainly had\\ntaught me something of its courage and selfishness. She had disabused\\nmy mind forever of the thought that it was a polite, intensified form\\nof liking. A blazing ship, she had met me in mid-ocean and had set\\nmy rigging aflame. I had turned from her, but not in time to get off\\nscatheless. Her wild unrestraint had accustomed my imagination to phases\\nof desire which had before seemed abnormal and foreign to my nature.\\n\\nWhen I missed her at Milan, I abandoned my pursuit of her. Now that the\\ntemptation was over, I realized how near we had come to wrecking each\\nother’s lives. Physical lassitude overtook me. Because I had withstood\\nFiesole, I thought myself safe in indulging my fancy with more intimate\\nthoughts of Vi. I excused myself for so doing, by telling myself that\\nit was her memory that had made me strong to escape. It was like saying\\nthat because water had rescued me from fire it could no longer drown me.\\n\\nI traveled northwards into the mountains to Raveno. Each morning I rowed\\nacross Maggiore to the island of Isola Madre. Lying beneath the camphor\\ntrees, watching the turquoise of the lake filling in the spaces between\\nthe yellowing bamboo canes, I gave rein to my longing. Shadowy foliage\\ndripped from shadowy trees, curtaining the glaring light; down spy-hole\\nvistas of overgrown pathways I watched the lazy world drift by. I numbed\\nmy cravings with the opiate of voluptuous beauty.\\n\\nI had been there a fortnight when a letter from home arrived. With its\\nconfident domestic chatter, it brought a message of trust. It took from\\nme my sense of isolation. One of them would understand.\\n\\nSlowly the thought had taken shape within me that I must go to Vi. If I\\nsaw her only once again, I believed that I would be satisfied. It would\\nnot be necessary to speak to her--that would be unsportsmanlike if she\\nhad managed to forget me. All I asked was to be allowed just once to\\nlook upon her face. She should not know that I was near her; I would\\nlook at her and go away. With that strange sophistry that we practise\\non ourselves, I tried to be persuaded that, were I to see her in her own\\nsurroundings with her husband and Dorrie, it would be a lesson to me\\nof how little share I had in her life. Perhaps I had even idealized her\\nmemory; seeing her might cure me. So I reasoned, but I was conscious\\nthat my own judgment on the wisdom of such a step was not to be trusted.\\nRuthita was too young to tell. My father, though I admired him, was not\\nthe man to whom a son would willingly betray a weakness. I would speak\\nto the Snow Lady.\\n\\nAs I drove from the station through London, old scenes and memories woke\\nto life. The city had spread out towards Stoke Newington, so that it\\nhad lost much of its quaintness; but it retained enough of its old-world\\nquiet to put me in touch with my childhood.\\n\\nI alighted at the foot of Pope Lane. The wooden posts still stood there\\nto shut out traffic. I walked quickly up the avenue of fragrant limes\\nwith the eager expectancy of one who had been years absent instead of\\ndays. In the distance I heard the rumble of London. The golden August\\nevening lay in pools upon the pathway. Sensations of the happy past came\\nback. Dead memories stirred, plucking at my heartstrings. I thought of\\nhow Ruthita and I had bowled hoops and played marbles on that same gray\\npavement, making the air ring with our childish voices. I thought of\\nthose rare occasions when the Spuffler had carried me away with him into\\na boy’s world of mysterious small things, which he knew so well how to\\nfind. All the comings and goings of school-days, immense exaltations\\nand magnified tragedies, rose before me--Ruthita waiting to catch first\\nsight of me, and Ruthita running beside the dog-cart, with flushed\\ncheeks and hair flying, to share the last of me as I drove away. What\\nhad happened since then seemed for the moment but an interlude in the\\nmomentous play.\\n\\nPassing between the steeply-rising red-brick walls, dotted with gates,\\nI came to the door through which I had been so eager to escape when it\\nhad been locked against me. I reflected that I had not gained much from\\nthe new things which I had dragged into my life. The narrowness which\\nI had once detested as imprisoned dullness I now coveted as peaceful\\nsecurity.\\n\\nI found the bell beneath the Virginia creeper. The door was opened by\\nHetty. Hetty had grown buxom and middle-aged. Her sweetheart had never\\ncome for her. The tradesmen no longer made love to her; they left their\\ngoods perfunctorily and went out in search of younger faces. Her hips\\nhad broadened. The curve between her bust and her waist had vanished.\\nThe dream of love was all that she had gained from life. I wondered\\nwhether she still told herself impossible stories of the deliverance\\nwrought by marriage. If she did, no signs of her romantic tendencies\\nrevealed themselves in her face. Her expression had grown vacantly\\nkind and stolid. To me she was respectful nowadays, and seemed even\\ndistressed by the immodesty of the memory that I had once been the\\nlittle boy whom she had spanked, spoilt, bathed, and dried.\\n\\nShe gave a quick cry at catching sight of me, for I had warned no one of\\nmy coming.\\n\\n“Sh! where are they?” I asked her.\\n\\nShe told me that the master was at work in his study, and that Miss\\nRuthita and her ma were in the garden.\\n\\nI walked round the house slowly, lasting out the pleasure of their\\nsurprise. Nothing seemed to have changed except we people. Sunflowers\\nkept guard in just the same places, like ranks of lean soldiers wearing\\ngolden helmets. Along the borders scarlet geraniums flared among the\\nblue of lobelia and the white of featherfew, just as they had when I was\\na boy. Pigeons, descendants of those whose freedom I had envied, perched\\non the housetops opposite, or wheeled against the encrimsoned sky.\\n\\nI stole across the lawn to where two stooping figures sat with their\\nbacks towards me. Halfway across I halted, gazing over my shoulder.\\nThrough the study-window, with ivy aslant the pane, I saw my father. His\\nhair was white. In the stoop of his shoulders was the sign of creeping\\nage. He did not look up to notice me; he had never had time. As the\\nyears went by I grew proudly sorry for him. I saw him now, as I had\\nseen him so many times when I paused to glance up from my play. He was\\ncramped above his desk, writing, writing. His face was turned away. His\\nhead was supported on his hand as though weary. _He_ was the prisoner\\nnow; it was I who held the key of escape. How oddly life had changed!\\n\\nRuthita saw me. Her sewing fell from her lap. In a trice she was racing\\ntowards me.\\n\\n“You! You!” she cried.\\n\\nHer thin arms went round me. Suddenly I felt miles distant from her\\nbecause I was unworthy.\\n\\n“Why did you come back?” she asked me. There was a note of anxiety in\\nher voice. She searched my bronzed face.\\n\\n“To see you, chickabiddy.”\\n\\n“No, no. That’s not true,” she whispered; but she pressed her cheek\\nagainst my shoulder as though she were willing to distrust her own\\ndenial. “You can get on quite well without me, Dannie; you would never\\nhave come back to see me only.”\\n\\nThe Snow Lady touched me on the elbow. Her eyes were excited and full\\nof questioning. She gazed quickly from me to Ruthita. With a\\nself-consciousness which was foreign to both of us, we dropped our eyes\\nunder her gaze and separated. Ruthita excused herself, saying that she\\nwould go and tell my father.\\n\\nThe Snow Lady offered me her cheek; it was soft and velvety. Slipping\\nher arm through mine, she led me away to the apple-tree under which\\nthey had been sitting. She was still the frail little Madam Favart,\\nhalf-frivolous, half-saintly; my father’s intense reticence had subdued,\\nbut not quite silenced her gaiety. Her silver hair was as abundant as\\never and her figure as girlish; but her face had tired lines, especially\\nabout the eyes. I sat myself on the grass at her feet.\\n\\n“How is he?” I asked.\\n\\n“Your father?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Much the same. He doesn’t change.”\\n\\n“Is he still at the same old grind?”\\n\\nShe nodded. “But, Dante,” she said, “you look thinner and older.”\\n\\n“That’s the heat and the rapid traveling. A day or two’s rest’ll put me\\nright.”\\n\\nShe dropped her sewing into her lap and, pressing her cool hand against\\nmy forehead, drew me back against her. It was a mothering love-trick of\\nhers that had lasted over from my childhood.\\n\\n“What brought you home so suddenly, laddie?”\\n\\nHer hand slipped to my shoulder. I bent aside and kissed it. “To see\\nyou and Ruthie. I had something to tell you.” She narrowed her eyes\\nshrewdly. “You’ve been worried for nearly a year now. I’ve noticed it.”\\n\\n“Have I shown it so plainly?”\\n\\n“Plainly enough for me to notice. Is it something to do with a woman?\\nBut of course it is--at your age only a woman could make you wear a\\nsolemn face.”\\n\\n“Yes. It’s a woman. And I want you to help me, Snow Lady, just as you\\nused to long ago when I couldn’t make things go right.”\\n\\nThe slow tears clouded her eyes; yet my news seemed to make her happy.\\n“When I was as old as you, Ruthie had been long enough with me to grow\\nlong curls.” She smiled inscrutably.\\n\\nFrom where we sat we could watch the house. While we had been talking,\\nI had seen through the study-window how Ruthita stole to my father’s\\nchair. He looked up irritably at being disturbed. Her attitude was all\\nmeekness and apology as she explained her intrusion. He seemed to\\nsigh at having to leave his work. She withdrew while he completed his\\nsentence. He laid his pen carefully aside, glanced out into the garden\\nshortsightedly, rose, and melted into the shadows at the back of his\\ncave. The door at the top of the steps opened. He descended slowly and\\ngravely, as though his brain was still tangled in the web of thought it\\nhad been weaving.\\n\\nWe sat together beneath the apple-tree while the light faded. Little\\novals of gold, falling flaky through leaves on the turf, paled\\nimperceptibly into the twilight grayness. My father’s voice was worn\\nand unsteady. It came over me that he had aged; up till now I had\\nnot noticed it. Beyond the wall in a neighboring garden children were\\nplaying; a woman called them to bed; a lawn-mower ran to and fro across\\nthe silence. He questioned me eagerly as to where I had been in Italy,\\npunctuating my answers and descriptions with such remarks as, “I always\\nwanted to go there--never had time--always felt that such a background\\nwould have made all the difference.”\\n\\nIt was noticeable that Ruthita and the Snow Lady suppressed themselves\\nin his presence; if they ventured anything, it was only to keep him\\ninterested or to lead his thoughts in happier directions. Presently he\\ntold them that they would be tired if they sat up later. Taking the hint\\nas a command, they bade us good-night.\\n\\nDarkness had gathered when they left us; to the southward London waved\\na torch against the clouds. We watched the lights spring up in the\\nbedrooms, and saw Ruthita and then the Snow Lady step to their windows\\nand draw down their blinds. Presently the lights went out.\\n\\n“Lord Halloway’s been here again.” When I waited for further explanation\\nmy father added, “Didn’t like the fellow at first; he improves on\\nacquaintance.”\\n\\nThen I spoke. “Depends how far you carry his acquaintance.”\\n\\nMy father fidgeted in his chair. “He’s got flaws in his character,\\nbut he’s honest in keeping back nothing. Most people in our position\\nwouldn’t hesitate two minutes over such a match.” Then, after a long\\npause, “And what’s to become of Ruthita when I die?”\\n\\nI took him up sharply. I was young enough to fear the mention of death.\\n“You’ll live for many years yet. After that, I’ll take care of her if\\nshe doesn’t marry.”\\n\\nMy father sat upright. I wondered how I had hurt him. He spoke stiffly.\\n“You’ll inherit Sir Charles’s money. When I married a first and a second\\ntime, I didn’t consult his convenience, and the responsibilities I\\nundertook are mine. Ruthita’s only your sister by accident; already\\nyou’ve been too much together. We must consider this offer apart from\\nsentiment. He’s sowed his wild oats--well, he’s sorry. And he’ll be the\\nEarl of Lovegrove by and by. To stand in her way would be selfishness.”\\n\\nHis argument took me by surprise. “Is Ruthita anxious for it? What does\\nshe say?”\\n\\n“She knows nothing of the world. She takes her coloring from you. She’s\\nafraid to speak out her mind. She thinks you would never forgive her.”\\n\\nHis voice was high-strung and challenging.\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” I said quietly. “She doesn’t love him--she’d be\\nselling herself for safety.”\\n\\nIn the interval that followed I could feel the grimness of his\\nexpression which the darkness hid from my eyes. “You’re young; you don’t\\nunderstand. For years I’ve had to struggle to make ends meet. I’m about\\ndone--I’m tired. If Ruthita were settled, I could lie down with an easy\\nmind. There’s enough saved to see me and her mother to our journey’s\\nend.”\\n\\nHe rose to his feet suddenly. “You think I’m acting shabbily.\\nGood-night.”\\n\\nHe walked away, a gaunt shadow moving through the silver night. The awe\\nI had of him kept me from following. I sat there and tried to puzzle out\\nhow this thing might be avoided. I could help financially; but my help\\nwould be refused because it was Sir Charles’s money.\\n\\nNext morning I woke at six and dressed. Dew was on the turf; it sparkled\\nin the gossamer veils of spider-webs caught among the bushes. Blackbirds\\nand thrushes in trees were calling. A cock crew, and a cock in the\\ndistance echoed. The childish thought came back to me--how much\\ngrown-ups miss of pleasure in their anxiety for the morrow. There is so\\nmuch to be enjoyed for nothing!\\n\\nA window-sash was raised sharply. Looking up I saw Ruthita in her white\\nnight-gown, with her hair tumbled like a cloud about her breast. I\\nwatched her, thinking her lovely--so timid and small and delicate. I\\ncalled to her softly; she started and drew back. I waited. Soon she came\\ndown to me in the garden. I must have eyed her curiously.\\n\\n“You’ve heard?”\\n\\nShe held out her hand pleadingly, afraid that I would judge her.\\n“They’re making me,” she cried, “and I don’t--don’t want to, Dannie.”\\n\\nI led her away behind the tool-shed at the bottom of the garden; it was\\nthe place where I had discovered Hetty in her one flirtation.\\n\\n“I’m not wanted,” moaned Ruthita; “I cost money. So they’re giving me to\\na man I don’t love.”\\n\\n“They shan’t,” I told her, slipping my arm about her. “You shall come to\\nme--I don’t suppose I shall ever marry.”\\n\\nShe nestled her head against my shoulder, saying, “You were always good\\nto me; I don’t know why. I’m not much use to anybody.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” I retorted. “None of us could get along without you.”\\n\\nThen I told her that if the pressure became unbearable she must come to\\nme. She promised.\\n\\nThe Snow Lady found us sitting there together; we made room for her\\nbeside us. Shortly after her coming Ruthita made an excuse to vanish.\\n\\nI turned to the Snow Lady abruptly. “She’s not going to marry Halloway.”\\n\\nShe raised her brows, laughing with her eyes. “Why not? Why so\\npositive?”\\n\\n“Because it’s an arranged marriage.”\\n\\n“Mine with her father was arranged; it was very happy.”\\n\\nSomehow I knew she was not serious.\\n\\n“You don’t want it?” I challenged.\\n\\n“No, I don’t want it; but Ruthita’s growing older. No one else has asked\\nfor her. It would be a shame if she became an old maid.”\\n\\n“She won’t.”\\n\\n“She won’t, if you say so,” said the Snow Lady.\\n\\nDuring breakfast my father was silent. He seemed conscious of a\\nconspiracy against him. When the meal was ended, he retired to\\nhis study, where he shut himself up, working morosely. I sought\\nopportunities to tell the Snow Lady what I had come to say, but I could\\nnever find an opening to introduce the name of Vi. Whenever we were\\nalone together she insisted on discussing Ruthita’s future, stating\\nand re-stating the reasons for and against the proposed match.\\nThe atmosphere was never sympathetic for the broaching of my own\\nperplexities. Gradually I came to see that I must make my decision\\nunaided; then I knew that I should decide in only one way. I engaged\\na passage to Boston provisionally, telling myself that it could be\\ncanceled. That I think was the turning-point, though I still pretended\\nto hesitate.\\n\\nThe day before the boat sailed, my father announced at table, avoiding\\nmy eyes, that Lord Halloway had written that he would call next day. I\\nwent to my bedroom and commenced to pack. Ruthita followed.\\n\\n“You’re going?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Because he’s coming?”\\n\\n“Partly.”\\n\\nHer eyes were blinded with tears; she sank against the wall in a fit of\\nsobbing. “Oh, I wish you could take me--I wish you could take me!” she\\ncried.\\n\\nI comforted her, telling her to be brave, reminding her of her promise\\nto come to me if they used pressure. She dabbed her eyes. “You and I’ve\\nalways stood together, little sister; you mustn’t be afraid,” I told\\nher.\\n\\nI carried my bags downstairs into the hall. The Snow Lady met me.\\n\\n“What’s this? You’re going?” Her voice reflected dismay and\\nbewilderment.\\n\\n“Yes, going.”\\n\\n“But not for long! You’ll be back shortly?”\\n\\n“That depends.”\\n\\nI entered my father’s study. He looked up from his writing. “I’m going\\naway.”\\n\\nHe held my hand in silence a moment; his throat was working; he would\\nnot look me in the eyes. “Won’t you stay?” he asked hoarsely.\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n“Good-by,” he muttered. “Don’t judge us harshly. Come back again.”\\n\\nRuthita accompanied me to the end of the lane. She did not come further;\\nshe was grown up now and ashamed to be seen crying. At the last minute\\nI wanted to tell her. I realized that she would understand--she was\\na woman. The knowledge came too late. She said she would write me at\\nOxford, and I did not correct her. I looked back as I went down the road\\nand waved. I turned a corner; she was lost to sight.\\n\\nNext day I sailed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV--I GO TO SHEBA\\n\\nA sleepy, contented little town, overshadowed by giant elms, sprawled\\nout along the banks of a winding river, surrounded for miles by\\nundulating woodlands--that is how I remember Sheba. The houses were for\\nthe most part of timber, and nearly all of them were painted white. They\\nsat each in its unfenced garden, comfortably separate from neighbors,\\nwith a green lawn flowing from the roadway all about it, and a nosegay\\nof salvias, hollyhocks, and lavender, making cheerfulness beside the\\npiazza. I suppose unkind things happened there, but they have left no\\nmark on my memory. When I think of Sheba there comes to me the sound of\\nbees humming, woodpeckers tapping, frogs croaking, and the sight of\\nblue indolent smoke curling above quiet gables, butterflies sailing over\\nflowers, a nodding team of oxen on a sunlit road hauling fagots into\\ntown and, after sunset hour, the indigo silence of dusk beneath orchards\\nwhere apples are dropping and fireflies blink with the eyes of goblins.\\n\\nSheba was one of those old New England towns from which the hurry of\\nlife has departed; it cared more for its traditions than for its future,\\nand sat watching the present like a gray spectacled grandmother, pleased\\nto be behind the times, with its worn hands folded.\\n\\nI arrived there with only a small sum of money and the price of my\\nreturn passage. I had limited my funds purposely, so that I might not be\\ntempted to prolong my visit.\\n\\nThe day after my arrival my calculations were upset; I discovered that\\nthe Carpenter house was shut, and that Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter had not\\nyet returned from the coast. This made me careful. I was unwilling to\\ndraw on my bank in London lest my whereabouts should be discovered,\\nwhich would necessitate awkward explanations to my family and the\\nassociation of Vi’s name with doubtful circumstances.\\n\\nIn my search for cheap lodgings I had a strange stroke of luck. Randall\\nCarpenter’s house stood in an old-world street, which at this time of\\nthe year was a tunnel through foliage. I waited until the gardeners had\\ndeparted. Evening came; pushing open the gate, I entered the grounds.\\n\\nI passed down a rough path under apple-trees, where fruit kept falling.\\nIn stables to the left, horses chafed in their stalls and snorted. To\\nthe right in the vegetable garden, birds of brilliant plumage flashed\\nand darted, and fat gray squirrels sat up quivering to watch me.\\nOverhead, near and far, the air vibrated with incessant twittering.\\nThe golden haze of sunset was over everything; the whole world seemed\\nenkindled. The path descended to low, flat meadows where haymaking\\nwas in progress. Farm implements stood carelessly about, ready for the\\nmorrow. In one field the hay was cocked, in another gathered, in a third\\nthe cutting had commenced. I told myself I was with her, and shivered at\\nthe aching loneliness of reality.\\n\\nCircling the meadows was a narrow stream, which at a little distance\\njoined the main river; on the farther side stood scattered cottages,\\nwith gardens straggling down a hill to its banks. In one of these a\\ngray-haired woman was working. She wore a sunbonnet and print-dress of\\nlavender. In my idleness I threw myself down in the grass and observed\\nher. She grew conscious that she was being watched, and cast sly\\nglances across her shoulder. At first I thought she was suspicious of\\nmy trespassing; she came lower down the hill and nodded in shy friendly\\nfashion.\\n\\n“Good-evening,” I called to her over the stream.\\n\\nShe drew herself erect and eyed me. “Guess you’re a stranger?” she\\nquestioned, having found something foreign in my English accent.\\n\\nI told her that I was, and then, for the sake of conversation, asked her\\nif she knew of any rooms to rent. “Guess I do,” she called back, “me and\\nmy sisters have one room to spare.”\\n\\nThat was how I came to take lodgings with the three Misses Januaries.\\nI paid them ten dollars weekly and had everything found. My room lay\\nat the back; from my window I could see much of what went on in Randall\\nCarpenter’s grounds.\\n\\nFrom the three Misses Januaries I learnt many things. They were decayed\\nladies and eked out a livelihood by bringing home piece-work to do for\\nthe jewelry factories. Every other day Miss Priscilla, the eldest, went\\nto deliver the finished task and to take further orders. Miss Priscilla\\nwas proud, angular, and bent. Miss Julia was round and jolly, but\\ncrippled with rheumatism. Miss Lucy, the youngest, had a weak spine and\\nwas never dressed; day after day she lay between white sheets dreamily\\nsmiling, small as a child, making hardly any mound in the bed.\\n\\nAt first they hid from me the fact that they worked. Then they pretended\\nthat they did it to occupy their leisure. Sewing was so useless, Miss\\nPriscilla said. At last they admitted the truth to the extent of letting\\nme sit with them in Miss Lucy’s bedroom, even allowing me to help them\\nwith the fastening of the interminable links that went to the making of\\none chain-bag.\\n\\nIt was during these meetings that they gossiped of their neighbors and\\nthemselves. By delicate manouvering I would lead the conversation\\nround to Vi. I found that for them Sheba was the one and only town,\\nand Randall Carpenter was its richest citizen. He stood behind all its\\nthriving institutions. He was president of the Sheba National Bank.\\nHe had controlling interest in the jewelry factory. He owned the\\ncotton-works. He had been Senator at Washington. Vi was the social\\nleader and the mirror of local fashion. They spoke of her as though she\\nembodied for them all that is meant by romance. They told me the story,\\nwhich I had already heard, of how Randall Carpenter had saved her\\nfather from ruin.\\n\\nWhile such matters were being discussed and fresh details added,\\nMiss Lucy would smile up at the ceiling, with her thin arms stretched\\nstraight out and her fingers plucking at the coverlet. I discovered\\nlater that long years before, Randall Carpenter had kept company with\\nher; then her spine trouble had commenced and their money had gone from\\nthem, and it had been ended. As a middle-aged bachelor he had married\\nVi, and now Miss Lucy re-lived her own girlhood in listening to stories\\nof Vi’s reported happiness.\\n\\nThree weeks after my arrival in Sheba Vi returned. The evening before\\nI had seen from my window that lights had sprung up in the house; early\\nnext morning I saw Dorrie in the garden, a white, diminutive, butterfly\\nfigure fluttering beneath the boughs. After breakfast I saw Vi come\\nout, walking with a portly man. An eighth of a mile separated us--by\\nlistening intently I could hear her voice when she called, “Dorrie,\\nDorrie.”\\n\\nTwice I came near to her, though she did not know it. One Sunday morning\\nI waited till service had commenced, and followed her to church. I\\nslipped into a seat at the back. There were few people present. From\\nwhere I sat I could get a clear view of her and her husband across\\nempty pews. Mr. Carpenter was a squarely-built, kindly-looking\\nman--unimaginative and mildly corpulent. His face was clean-shaven and\\nruddy. He had an air of benevolent prosperity; his hair was grizzled,\\nthe top of his head was bald and polished. When he offered me the plate\\nin taking the collection, I noticed that his fingers were podgy. I\\nremembered Vi’s continually reiterated assertion that he was so kind to\\nher. I knew what she had meant--kind, but lacking subtlety in expressing\\nthe affections. I judged that he was the sort of person to whom life had\\nscattered largesse--he had never been tested, and consequently accepted\\nall good fortune as something merited. His wide shrewd eyes had a steely\\ngleam of justice; the puckered eye-lids promised humor. He was lovable\\nrather than likable--a big boy, a mixture of naïve self-complacency and\\nmasterfulness. Before the benediction was pronounced, I left.\\n\\nThis was the first time I had seen him at close quarters. I had come\\nprepared to find faults in the man; I was surprised at my lack of anger.\\nHis comfortable amiability disarmed me.\\n\\nThe second time I came near to her was at nightfall. It was November. A\\ntouch of frost had nipped the leaves to blood-red; the Indian Summer\\nhad commenced. The air was pungent with the walnut fragrance of decaying\\nfoliage; violet mist trailed in shreds from thickets, like a woman’s\\nscarf torn from her throat in the passage. I had wandered out into\\nthe country. An aimless restlessness was on me--a sense of defiant\\nself-dissatisfaction.\\n\\nOccupied with my thoughts, I was strolling moodily along with hands in\\npockets, when I chanced to look up. She was coming down the road towards\\nme. She was alone; her trim, clean-cut figure made a silhouette against\\nthe twilight. She was whistling like a boy as she approached; her skirt\\nwas short to the ankles; she carried a light cane in her hand. I wanted\\nto stand still till she had come up with me and then to catch her in\\nmy arms before she was aware. For a moment I halted irresolute; then I\\nturned into the woods to the left.\\n\\nI could not understand how she could be so near to me and not know\\nit. It seemed to me that I would raise clenched hands against\\nthe coffin-lid, were she to approach me, though I was buried deep\\nunderground.\\n\\nAs the year drew towards a close my uncertainty of mind became a\\ntorture. I knew that I ought to return to England; I was breaking the\\npromise I had made to myself. My friends must be getting anxious.\\nBy this time Sir Charles must have heard of my disappearance. I was\\nimperiling my future by stopping. Worse still, the longer I lived near\\nVi, the more difficult was I making it for myself to take up the threads\\nof my old life without her. I continually set dates for my departure,\\nand I continually postponed them. At last I booked my passage some way\\nahead for the first week in January. In order to prevent myself from\\naltering my decision, I told Miss Priscilla that I was going.\\n\\nI fought a series of never finished battles with myself. As the time of\\nmy respite shortened, I grew frenzied. Was I to go away forever without\\nspeaking to her? Was I to give her no sign of my presence? Was I to let\\nher think that I had forgotten her and had ceased to care? I kept myself\\nawake of nights on purpose to make my respite go further; from where\\nI lay on the pillow with my face turned to the snow-covered meadows, I\\ncould see the blur which was her house. Sometimes in the darkness, when\\none loses all standards, I determined to risk everything and go to her.\\nWith morning I mastered myself and saw clearly--to go to her would be\\nbasest selfishness.\\n\\nIn one of my long tramps I had come upon a pond in a secluded stretch\\nof woodland on the outskirts of Sheba. On the last evening before my\\ndeparture I remembered it. I was in almost hourly fear of myself--afraid\\nthat I would seek her out. I planned diversions of thought and action\\nfor my physical self, so that my will might keep it in subjection. This\\nevening, when I was at a loss what to do, the inclination occurred to go\\nthere skating.\\n\\nAs I walked along the road, sleighs slid by with bells jingling. The\\nmerry golden windows of white houses in white fields brought a sense of\\npeacefulness. The night was blue-black; the sky was starry; the air had\\nthat deceptive dryness which hides its coldness. Beneath the woods trees\\ncast intricate sprawling traceries of shadows. Every now and then the\\nfrozen silence was shattered by the snapping of some overladen bough;\\nthen the whole wood shook and shivered as though it were spun from\\nglassy threads.\\n\\nPicking my way through bushes, I came to the edge of the pond and sat\\ndown to adjust my skates. It was perhaps four hundred yards in extent\\nand curved in the middle, so that one could not see from end to end. To\\nthe right grew a plantation of firs almost large enough for cutting; on\\nthe other three sides lay tangled swamp and brushwood.\\n\\nI had risen to my feet and was on the point of striking out, when I\\nheard a sound which was unmistakable, _rrh! rrh! rrh!_--the sharp ring\\nof skates cutting against ice.\\n\\nFrom a point above me at the edge of the fir-grove a figure darted out\\nand vanished round the bend. The moon was just rising; behind bars of\\ntall trunks I could see its pale disk shining--the pond had not yet\\ncaught its light.\\n\\nI felt foolishly angry and disappointed that I was not to have my last\\nevening to myself. I was jealous that some stranger, to whom it would\\nlack the same intensity, should share this memory. Unreasonable chagrin\\nheld me hesitant; I was minded to steal away unnoticed.\\n\\nThe intruder had reached the far end of the pond--there was silence.\\nThen the _rrh! rrh! rrh!_ commenced again, coming back. I set out to\\nmeet it; it was eerie for two people to be within earshot, but out of\\nsight in that still solitude. We swung round the corner together; the\\nmoon peered above the tree-tops. For an instant we were face to face,\\nstaring into one another’s eyes; then our impetus carried us apart into\\nthe dusk.\\n\\nI listened, and heard nothing but the brittle shuddering of icicles as\\nboughs strained up to free themselves. Stealing back round the bend, I\\ncame upon her standing fixed and silent; as I approached her, she spread\\nher hands before her eyes in a gesture of terror.\\n\\n“Vi, Vi,” I whispered, “it’s Dante.”\\n\\nShe muttered to herself in choking, babbling fashion.\\n\\nWhen I had put my arms about her, she ceased to speak, but her body was\\nshaken with sobbing. She made no sound, but a deep convulsive trembling\\nran through her. I talked to her soothingly, trying to convince her I\\nwas real. Slowly she relaxed against me sighing, and trusted herself to\\nlook up at me, letting her fingers wander over my face and hands. I had\\nbrought her the bitterness of remembrance. Stooping, I kissed her mouth.\\n“Just once,” I pleaded, “after all these months of loneliness. I’m going\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\n“You must,” she said, freeing herself from my embrace and clasping her\\narms about my neck; “oh, it’s wrong, but I’ve wanted you so badly.”\\n\\nI led her to the edge of the pond and removed her skates. The moon had\\nnow sailed above the spear-topped firs and the ice was a silver mirror.\\nWalking through the muffled woods I told her of my coming to Sheba, of\\nthe window from which I had watched her, and of all that had happened.\\nFrom her I learnt that she also had been going through the same struggle\\nbetween duty and desire ever since we parted.\\n\\n“Sometimes I felt that it was no use,” she said; “I couldn’t fight any\\nlonger--I must write or come to you. Then something would happen; I\\nwould read or hear of a woman who had done it, and in the revulsion I\\nfelt I realized how other people would feel about myself. And I saw how\\nit would spoil Randall’s life, and especially what it would mean to\\nDorrie. You can’t tell your personal excuses to the world; it just\\njudges you wholesale by what you do, and I couldn’t bear that. It’s so\\neasy to slip into temptation, Dante, especially our kind of temptation;\\nbecause we love one another, anything we might do seems good. You can\\nonly see what sin really is when you picture it in the lives of others.”\\n\\nWe were walking apart now; she had withdrawn her arm from mine. “I shall\\nalways love you,” I said.\\n\\n“And I you.”\\n\\n“I shall never marry any other woman,” I told her; “I shall wait for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Poor boy,” she murmured, “it isn’t even right for you to think of\\nthat.”\\n\\nThen, because there were things we dared not mention, we fell to talking\\nabout Dorrie, how she was growing, how she was losing her lisp, and all\\nthe tender little coaxing ways she had of making people happy.\\n\\nWe came out of the woods on the road which led back to Sheba. The lights\\ntwinkling ahead and the occasional travelers passing, robbed us of the\\ndanger of being alone together. I think she had been waiting for that.\\n\\n“Dante,” she said, smiling at me bravely, “there is only one thing for\\nyou to do--you must marry.”\\n\\n“Marry,” I exclaimed, “some woman whom I don’t love!”\\n\\n“Not that,” she said; “but many men learn to love a second woman. I’ve\\noften thought you should be happy with Ruthita; you love her already.\\nAfter you had had children, you’d soon forget me. You’d be able to smile\\nabout it. Then it would be easier for me to forget.”\\n\\nMy answer was a tortured whisper. “It’s impossible; I’m not made like\\nthat. For my own peace of mind I almost wish I were.”\\n\\nWe came to the gate of her house. Across the snow, beneath the gloom of\\nelms lighted windows smote the darkness with bars of gold. Within one\\nof the rooms a man was stirring; he came to the panes and looked out,\\nwatching for her return.\\n\\n“He’s always like that; he can’t bear to be without me. I had one of my\\nmoods this evening, when I want to be alone--he knew it.”\\n\\n“When you wanted to think of me; that’s what you meant--why didn’t you\\nsay it?”\\n\\n“One daren’t say these things, when they’re saying good-by, perhaps for\\never.”\\n\\nShe had her hand on the gate, preparing to enter; we neither of us knew\\nwhat to say at parting. The things that were in my heart I must not\\nutter, and all other things seemed trivial. I looked from her to the\\nburly figure framed in the glowing window. I pitied him with the proud\\npity of youth for age, a pity which is half cruel. After all, she loved\\nme and we had our years before us. We could afford disappointment, we\\nwhose lives were mostly in the future; his life was two-thirds spent,\\nand his years were running out.\\n\\nLooking up the path in his direction, I asked, “Shall you tell him?”\\n\\n“He has known for a year; it was only fair.”\\n\\n“And he was angry? He blamed you?”\\n\\n“He was sorry. I wish he had blamed me. He blames himself, which is the\\nhardest thing I have to bear.”\\n\\n“Vi,” I said, “he’s a good man--better than I am. You must learn to love\\nhim.”\\n\\nShe held out her hand quickly; her voice was muffled. “Good-night, my\\ndearest, and good-by.”\\n\\nThe gate clanged. As she ran up the path, I saw that her husband had\\nmoved from the window. He opened the door to her; in the lighted room I\\nsaw him put his arms about her. By the way she looked up at him and he\\nbent over her, I knew she was confessing.\\n\\nThen I shambled down the road, feeling very old and tired. I was so\\ntired that I hardly knew how to finish my packing; I was cold, bitterly\\ncold. I dragged myself to bed; in order to catch the boat in Boston, I\\nhad to make an early start next morning. My teeth were chattering and my\\nflesh was burning. Several times in the night I caught myself speaking\\naloud, saying stupid, tangled things about Vi. Then I thought that what\\nI had said had been overheard. I shouted angrily to them to go away,\\ndeclaring, that I had not meant what I said.\\n\\nWhen my eyes closed, the stars were going out. “It will soon be\\nmorning,” I told myself; “I must get up and dress.”\\n\\nI tried to get up, but my head would stick to the pillow and my body\\nrefused to work. “That’s queer,” I thought; “never mind, I’ll try\\nlater.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV--THE FLAME OF A SWORD\\n\\nOne morning, it seemed the one on which I had planned to sail, I awoke\\nin a strange room. I knew it was strange because the sun was pouring in\\nacross the bed, and the sun never looked through my window at the\\nMisses Januaries’ till late in the afternoon. Something wet was on my\\nforehead--a kind of bandage that came down low across my eyes almost\\npreventing me from seeing anything. This set me wondering in a slow,\\nthick-witted manner.\\n\\nI did not much care how I came to be there--I felt effortless and\\ncontented; yet, in a lazy way, my mind became interested. I lay still,\\npiecing together little scraps of happenings as I remembered them. The\\nlast thing I could recall that was rational was my attempting to get out\\nof bed. Then came vague haunting shapes, too sweet and too horrible\\nfor reality--things which refused to be embodied and remained mere\\natmospheres in the brain, terrors and delights of sleep which slowly\\nfaded as the mind cleared itself.\\n\\nI pulled my hand from under the sheets and was surprised at the effort\\nit took to raise it to my forehead. I heard the rustle of a starched\\nskirt: it was the kind of sound that Hetty used to make in my childhood,\\nwhen she came to dress me in the mornings and I pretended that I still\\nslept. I used to think in those days that it was a stern clean sound\\nwhich threatened me with soap and chilly water. Someone was bending over\\nme; a cool voice said, “Don’t move, Mr. Cardover. I’ll do that.”\\n\\nThe bandage was pushed back and in the sudden rush of light I saw a\\nyoung woman in a blue print-dress, standing beside my pillow. I tried\\nto speak to her, but my mouth was parched and my voice did not make the\\nproper sound.\\n\\n“Don’t try to speak,” she said; “you’ve been sick, you know. Soon you’ll\\nfeel better.”\\n\\nI stopped trying to talk and obeyed her, just as I used to obey Hetty.\\nAt the back of my mind I smiled to myself that I, a grown man, should\\nobey her; she looked such a girl. After she had put water to my lips and\\npassed a damp cloth over my face and hands, she nodded pleasantly and\\nwent back to her seat by the window.\\n\\nNo--until now I had never seen this room. The walls were covered in\\ncherry- satin, which was patterned in vertical stripes, with\\nbunches of flowers woven in between the lines. All the wood-work was\\npainted a gleaming white. Chippendale chairs and old-fashioned delicate\\nbits of furniture stood about in odd corners. Between the posts of the\\nbig Colonial bed I could see a broad bay-window, with a seat going round\\nit. Across the panes leafless boughs cast a net-work of shadows, and\\nthrough them fell a bar of solid sunlight in which dust-motes were\\ndancing by the thousand. Half-way down each side of the bed screens were\\nstanding, so that I could only see straight before me and a part of the\\nroom to the left and right beyond where they ended.\\n\\nThrough weakness I was powerless to speak or stir, yet my swimming\\nsenses were anxiously alert. I saw objects without their perspective,\\nas though I were gazing up through water. In the same way with sounds,\\nI heard them thunderously and waited in suspense for their repetition.\\nThough I lay so still, nothing missed my attention.\\n\\nBy the quietness of the house I gathered that the hour was yet early.\\nFar away cocks crew their rural challenge. On a road near by footsteps\\npassed in a hurry. The whistle of a factory sounded; then I knew\\nthey had been footsteps of people going to work. Beneath the window a\\ngarden-roller clanged across gravel, and became muffled as it reached\\nthe turf. A door banged remotely; a few seconds later someone tapped on\\nthe door of my bedroom. The nurse laid aside her knitting and rustled\\nover to the threshold. A question was asked in a low whisper and the\\nnurse’s voice answered.\\n\\nA woman entered into the bar of sunlight and stood regarding me from the\\nfoot of the bed. With the immense indifference of weakness I gazed back.\\nHer long, fine-spun hair hung loose about her shoulders like a mantle.\\nShe wore a blue dressing-gown, which she held together with one hand\\nacross her breast. Her eyes were still sleepy; she had come directly she\\nhad wakened to inquire after me. She smiled at me, nodding her head.\\nShe seemed very distant; I wanted to return her smile, but I had not the\\nenergy. I closed my eyes; when I looked again she had vanished.\\n\\nFor the next few days I do not know how many people came and looked\\nat me, whispered a few words and went. There was the old gray-haired\\ndoctor, with his military-bearing and his trick of pursing his lips and\\nknitting his brows as he took my temperature. I had one visitor who was\\nregular--Randall Carpenter. He looked years older. Tiptoeing into the\\nroom, he would seat himself in the bay-window; from there he would gaze\\nat me moodily without a word, with his knees spread apart, and his podgy\\nhands clasped together. Sometimes I would doze while he watched me and\\nwould awake to find him still there, his position unaltered. One thing I\\nnoticed; Vi and he were never in my room together.\\n\\nIn these first days, which slipped by uncounted, I realized that I had\\nbeen very near to death. It seemed to me that my spirit still hovered on\\nthe borderland and looked back across the boundary half-regretful. I had\\nthe feeling that life was a thing apart from me--something which I was\\nunanxious to share. All these people came and went, but I could not\\nrespond to them. I desired only to be undisturbed.\\n\\nSeveral times I had heard the shrill piping voice of Dorrie and the long\\nlow _hush_ of someone warning her to speak less loudly. She would come\\nto the door many times in the day, inquiring impatiently whether I were\\nbetter. Sometimes she would leave flowers, which the nurse would put in\\nwater and set down by the side of my bed. I would watch them dreamily,\\nsaying to myself, “Dorrie’s flowers.”\\n\\nOne afternoon I heard her voice at the door, asking “Nurth, how ith\\nDante?” The nurse had left the room for a moment, so no one answered\\nher question. I heard the door pushed wider, and stealthy feet slipping\\nacross the carpet. Round the edge of the screen came the excited face\\nand little shining head. I held out my hand to her and tried to speak.\\nThen I tried again and whispered, “Dorrie! Dorrie darling!”\\n\\nShe took my hand in both her small ones, trying to mask the fear which\\nmy changed appearance caused her. “Dear Dante,” she whispered, “I’m tho\\nthorry.”\\n\\n“Kiss me, Dorrie,” I said.\\n\\n“Dear Dante, you’ll get better, won’t you? For my thake, Dante! Then\\nwe’ll play together, like we uthed to.” Tears trickled down her flushed\\ncheeks as she questioned.\\n\\nAs her soft lips brushed me and her silky curls fell about my forehead,\\nI felt for the first time that my grip on life was coming back. Lying\\nthere thinking things over confusedly, it had seemed hardly worth while\\ntrying to get better. It seemed worth while, now that I was reminded\\nthat there was such beautiful innocence as Dorrie’s in the world.\\n\\nWhen the nurse came back a few moments later, she shook her head at\\nDorrie reproachfully and tried to take her away from me.\\n\\n“But he wanths me,” cried Dorrie in self-defense, and I kept fast hold\\nof her.\\n\\nAfter that I began to gather strength. I noticed that as I threw off my\\nlethargy, Vi’s visits grew less frequent. When she came her manner\\nwas restrained; she entered hurriedly and made it appear that her only\\nreason for coming was to confer with the nurse. At first I would follow\\nher about with my eyes; but when I found how much it embarrassed her, I\\npretended to be dozing when I heard her enter.\\n\\nI could not understand how I came to be in Randall Carpenter’s house. I\\ndared not ask Vi or her husband; my presence implied too much already. I\\nwas afraid to ask the nurse; I did not know how much I should be telling\\nby my question. There seemed to be a polite conspiracy of silence\\nagainst me. I wondered where it would all end.\\n\\nI had grown to like the old doctor. He was a shrewd, wise, serious man.\\nHe never spoke a word of religion, yet he made his religion felt by his\\nkindness. As he went about his work, he would become chatty, trying\\nto rouse my interest. He spoke a good deal about himself and told me\\nanecdotes of scenes which he had lived through in the War, when he had\\nbeen a surgeon in the Northern army. Out of his old tired eyes he would\\nwatch me narrowly; I began to feel that he understood.\\n\\nOne day I whispered to him to send away the nurse. He invented an errand\\nfor her, saying that he would stay with me till she returned. When she\\nhad gone, he closed the door carefully and came and sat down on the side\\nof the bed. “Now, what is it, my boy?”\\n\\n“What happened, doctor?”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips judicially and looked away from me for a full minute,\\nas though he would escape answering; then his eyes came back and I saw\\nthat he was going to tell.\\n\\n“I reckoned you’d be asking that question,” he said.\\n\\n“The morning that you figured to sail, you were taken sick at the Misses\\nJanuaries’. You were mighty bad when they sent for me; you had pneumonia\\nand a touch of brain-fever. It’s a close call you’ve had. I found you\\nwandering in your head--and saying things.”\\n\\n“Things, doctor? Things that I wouldn’t want heard?”\\n\\nHe nodded gravely. “No one in Sheba knew anything about you. I saw that\\nyou were in for a long spell, and that the Misses Januaries’ was no\\nplace for you to get proper nursing.”\\n\\nHe halted awkwardly. “Then I came to Randall and told him.”\\n\\n“Had I mentioned him in my delirium?”\\n\\n“You’d mentioned her.”\\n\\nI could feel the warm flush of color spreading through my body and\\nturned away my head. The old doctor gripped my hand. “That’s how it\\nhappened, I guess.” Little by little he told me about Randall Carpenter.\\nDuring the first days of crisis he had scarcely gone to bed, but had\\npaced the house, always returning to my bedroom door to see if he could\\nbe of any service.\\n\\n“But, why should he care?” I questioned.\\n\\n“Because she cared, I guess. He’s so fond of her that he wants to do\\nmore than ever she could ask him. And then, Randall’s a mighty just man,\\nand he’s always most just when he’s most tempted.”\\n\\nHe looked down at me sidelong and silence fell between us. It was broken\\nby the footfall of the nurse along the passage. I asked him quickly when\\nI should be well enough to be moved.\\n\\n“You’re some better now, but we mustn’t think of moving you yet, though,\\nof course, you must go at the earliest.” Towards midnight the nurse took\\nmy temperature. I saw that she was surprised, for she took it a second\\ntime. “Have you any pain?” she asked me.\\n\\nRandall Carpenter came in and they went away together. I lay staring up\\nat the ceiling, my hands clenched and my eyes burning. They all knew; I\\nalone was ignorant of what things I had said.\\n\\nA carriage came bowling up the driveway. I recognized whose it was, for\\nI had become familiar with the horse’s step. The doctor came into the\\nroom; as he bent over me our eyes met. I clutched his arm and he stooped\\nlower. “Stay and talk with me,” I whispered. “You all look at me and\\nnone of you will tell me. I can’t bear it--can’t bear it any longer.”\\n\\n“What can’t you bear?”\\n\\n“Not knowing.”\\n\\nWhen he had told them that there was no change for the worse and had\\nsent them back to bed, he came and sat down beside me. The lights in the\\nroom were extinguished, save for a reading lamp in a far corner where\\nthe nurse had been sitting.\\n\\n“I guess something’s troubling you. Take your time and tell me slowly.\\nI’ll sure help you, if I can.”\\n\\n“Doctor, you know about me and Mrs. Carpenter?”\\n\\n“I reckon you’re sort of fond of her--is that it?”\\n\\nI buried my face against the cool pillow. I dared not look at him, but\\nhe signaled me courage with the pressure of his hand.\\n\\n“More than fond, that’s why I came to Sheba. I didn’t mean to let her\\nknow that I’d ever been here; that last evening we met by accident. I\\nwas a fool to have come. I’ve been unfair to her--unfair to everybody.”\\n\\nHe did not answer me; he could not deny my assertion.\\n\\n“You remember what you said this afternoon--that I let things out in my\\ndelirium. I want to know what they were. I’ve been trying to remember;\\nbut it all comes wild and confused. Tell me, did I say anything that\\nwould make her ashamed of me--anything that would make her hate me?”\\n\\nHe shook his head. “Nothing that would make her hate you. Perhaps,\\nthat’s the worst of it.”\\n\\n“Well then, anything that would damage her reputation? Was I brought\\nhere only to prevent strangers from listening to what I said, just as\\nyou’d shut a mad dog up for safety?”\\n\\nIn my feverish suspense, I gained sudden strength and raised myself up\\non my elbow to face him. He patted me gently on the shoulder, saying,\\n“Lie down; it’s a sick man’s fancy. You’re guessing wide of the mark--it\\nwas nothing such as that.” He tucked me up and smoothed out the sheets.\\n\\n“Now stay still and I’ll tell you. You were calling for her when I\\ncame to you. At first we didn’t know what you meant; then you mentioned\\nDorrie. Only Miss Priscilla and I heard what you were saying; you can\\ntrust Miss Priscilla not to speak about it. I let Randall know and\\nhe brought his wife over with him. Directly she touched you, you grew\\nquiet. It was Randall suggested you being brought here; he was sorry for\\nyou and it was kindness made him do it. All through your illness till\\nyou came to yourself, Mrs. Carpenter sat by you; whenever she left you,\\nyou grew restless. She and her husband saved your life, I guess.”\\n\\n“But what makes them all so strange to me now?”\\n\\nHe fidgeted and cleared his throat. “It’s the truth I’m wanting,” I\\nurged.\\n\\n“Randall saw what she meant to you.”\\n\\n“Anything else?”\\n\\n“And what you meant to her.”\\n\\nAgainst my will a wave of joy throbbed through me. I felt like sobbing\\nfrom relief and happiness. Then a clear vision of the reality came\\nto me--the great silent man who stared at me for hours, and the\\nhigh-spirited woman, so suddenly grown timid, stealing in and out the\\nroom with averted eyes in pallid meekness.\\n\\n“What ought I to do?” My voice choked me as I asked it.\\n\\nHe turned his wise, care-wrinkled face towards me gravely. “I’m\\nwondering,” he said. “There’s only one thing to do--ask God about it.\\nYou did wrong in coming--there’s no disguising that. But the good God’s\\nspared you. He knows what He means you to do. I’m an old fellow, and\\nI’ve seen a heap of suffering and trouble. I’ve seen men die on the\\nbattlefield, and I’ve seen ’em go under when it was least expected. I\\ndon’t know how I’d have come through, if I hadn’t believed God knew what\\nHe was doing. I guess if He’d been lazy, like me and you, He’d just have\\nlet you slip out, ’cause it seemed easiest. But He hasn’t, and He knows\\nwhy He hasn’t. I’d just leave it in His hands.”\\n\\nLong after he had ceased to speak, I lay thinking of his words--thinking\\nhow simple life would be if God were exactly like this old man. Then\\nI began to hope that He might be--a kind of doctor of sick souls, who\\nwould get up out of bed and come driving through the night without\\ncomplaining, just to bring quiet to sinful people like myself. I closed\\nmy eyes, trying to think that God sat beside me. Some time must have\\nelapsed, but when I looked round the doctor was still there. His head\\nwas bowed forward from his bent shoulders, nodding.\\n\\n“You’re tired. I can sleep now.”\\n\\nHe awoke with a jerk. His last words to me before he left were, “Just\\nleave it in His hands.”\\n\\nFrom then on there was a changed atmosphere in the house. We had all\\nbeen afraid of one another and of one another’s misunderstandings.\\n\\nWhen Dorrie had gone to bed, Vi would sit within the circle of the lamp\\nand read to me while I lay back on my pillows in the shadows, watching\\nhow the gold light broke about her face and hands. She was always doing\\nsomething, either reading or sewing, as though when we were alone she\\nwere afraid to trust herself.\\n\\nOne evening she said to me, “You haven’t asked if there are any\\nletters.”\\n\\n“I wasn’t expecting any.”\\n\\n“Weren’t expecting any! Why not?”\\n\\n“Because none of my friends know that I’ve come to Sheba.”\\n\\nShe drew her face back from the lamp; her sewing fell from her hands. My\\nwords had reminded us both of the guilty situation which lay unchanged\\nbehind our present attitude.\\n\\nIt was she who broke the silence. “When you were taken ill I wrote\\nRuthita and told her--and told her that you were being nursed in our\\nhouse.”\\n\\nShe brought me my letters and then made an excuse to leave me to myself.\\nMy father had written; so had the Snow Lady. After expressing concern\\nfor my health, the tone of their letters became constrained and\\nunnatural; they refrained from accusing me, but they had guessed.\\nRuthita’s was an awkward, shamefaced little note--it puzzled me by\\nomitting to say anything of Halloway.\\n\\nMore and more after this Vi showed fear of being left alone with me; any\\nmoment a slip of the tongue might betray our passion. Frequently during\\nthe evening hours Mr. Carpenter would join us. He would steal into the\\nroom while Vi was reading and sit down by my bedside. I began to\\nhave great sympathy for the man. Vi’s actions to him were those of a\\ndaughter, and he, when he addressed her, called her “My child.” Both\\ntheir attitudes to one another were wrong--it hurt me to watch them;\\nthey made such efforts to create the impression that everything was\\nwell. Sitting beside me while she read, he would fasten his eyes on\\nher. If she smiled across at him in turning a page, his heavy face would\\nflood with a quite disproportionate joy. He was too fine a man for the\\npart he was playing; he had strength of character and mastery over men.\\n\\nAlong his own lines he had a wonderful mind. It was always scheming for\\nefficiency, concentration, and bigger projects. If money was the reward\\nof his energy, the desire for power impelled him. But I could quite\\nunderstand how a woman might yearn for more human interests and more\\nsubtle methods of conveying affection than the mere piling of luxury on\\nluxury. He could articulate his deepest emotions only in acts.\\n\\nOne evening when Vi had excused herself on the ground that she had\\na headache, I took the opportunity to thank him for his kindness. He\\nbecame as confused as if I had discovered him in a lie.\\n\\n“My dear boy, you mustn’t speak to me like that; you don’t owe me\\nanything. It is I who owe you everything.”\\n\\nI was staggered by his disclaimer. Under existing circumstances it\\nseemed a superlative extravagance of language. Then he explained, “If it\\nhadn’t been for you, we shouldn’t have Vi.”\\n\\nIt was the first reference that any of us had made to what had happened\\nat Ransby.\\n\\nAfter that Randall Carpenter and I grew to be friends. We didn’t do much\\ntalking about it, but we each realized how the other felt....\\n\\nI was almost sufficiently recovered to travel. I broached the subject of\\nmy leaving several times--the first time at breakfast. Randall\\nglanced up sharply from the letter he was opening--his expression\\nclouded--instead of looking at me he stared at Vi. “Certainly not.\\nCertainly not,” he blustered. “Couldn’t hear of it.”\\n\\nDorrie added her piping protest. Vi alone was silent. Every time I\\napproached the subject it was the same. The truth was our relations were\\nso delicately balanced that the slightest disturbance would precipitate\\na crisis--and the crisis we dreaded. We each one knew that the time for\\nfrank speaking could scarcely be avoided, but we were eager to postpone\\nit. So we procrastinated, lengthening out our respite.\\n\\nOne afternoon I returned with Randall from a drive to find Vi waiting\\nfor us at the gate. Her face was drawn with anxiety.\\n\\n“What’s happened?” asked Randall, and the sharpness of suspense was in\\nhis voice.\\n\\nVi handed me a cable. It was my recall--we all knew that. I ripped\\nthe envelope in haste; what I read, strange to say, caused me no\\nelation--only the bitterness of finality. I raised my eyes; they were\\nboth staring at me. “My grandfather’s dead. His will’s in my favor. I\\nmust return to England immediately.”\\n\\nThey received the news as though a blow had fallen. Vi crept in and out\\nthe rooms with a masked expression of unspoken tragedy. Dorrie caused\\nfrequent embarrassment by her coaxing attempts to make me promise to\\nvisit them again. Nevertheless, when she had gone to bed and we no\\nlonger had her to distract us, we would pass more painful hours in\\ninventing small talk to tide us over dangerous topics.\\n\\nThe night before I sailed, we kept Dorrie up till she fell asleep\\nagainst me. Her innocence was a barrier between us. When she had been\\ncarried to bed, Vi sat down to the piano and sang, while we two men\\nglowered desperately before the fire. I dared not watch her; I could not\\nbear the pain that was in her eyes. As I listened, I knew that her chief\\ndifficulty in selections was what to avoid. We were in a mood to read\\ninto everything a sentimental interpretation.\\n\\nThere were long pauses between her playing, during which no one spoke\\nand the only sound to be heard was the falling of ashes in the grate.\\nThe way in which we were grouped seemed symbolic--she at the piano apart\\nfrom us, while we were side by side; by loving her, we had pushed her\\nout of both our lives. Randall turned querulously in his chair, “Why\\ndon’t you go on playing, my child?”\\n\\nSeveral times she half-commenced an air and broke off. Her voice was\\na blind thing, tottering down an endless passage. For a horrid minute\\nthere was dead silence--quivering suspense; then the keys crashed\\ndiscordantly as she gave way to a storm of weeping.\\n\\nShe rose with an appealing gesture, and slipped out. We heard her\\nfootsteps trailing up the stairs, her door close, and then stillness.\\n\\nI shuddered as though a window had been flung open behind me and a\\ncold wind blew across my back. The man at my side huddled down into his\\nchair; his fleshy face had lost its firmness; his eyes, like a statue’s,\\nseemed without pupils. The moment which we had dreaded and postponed had\\narrived.\\n\\nRandall followed her into the hall; he came back, shutting the door\\ncarefully behind him. There was slow decision in his voice when he said,\\n“After all, we’ve got to speak about it.”\\n\\nHe sank down, his cheeks blotchy and his hands quivering as with palsy.\\nWhen he spoke, he tried to make his voice steady and matter-of-fact. It\\nwas as though he were saying, “We’ve got to be commonsense, we men of\\nthe world. We knew this would happen. There’s nothing to be gained by\\nlosing our nerves.”\\n\\nThis is what he actually said, “It isn’t her fault. You and I are to\\nblame.”\\n\\n“Not you,” I protested. “It’s I who’ve behaved abominably.”\\n\\nHe shifted in his chair; struck a match; raised it part way to his cigar\\nand let it flicker out. Without looking at me he answered, “We shan’t\\ngain anything by quarreling over who’s to blame. We’ve got her into a\\nmess between us--it’s up to us to get her out.”\\n\\n“But you didn’t----”\\n\\nHe flung out his arm in irritation. “Don’t waste words. I married her\\nwhen she was too young to know what marriage meant; I loved her and\\nsupposed that nothing else mattered. That’s my share. You made love to\\nmy wife and followed her to Sheba. That’s yours. We’ve got her into a\\nmess between us, and we’ve got to get her out.”\\n\\nHe waited for me to make a suggestion; I was too much taken aback. We\\ncouldn’t get her out; we could only help her to endure it. We both knew\\nthat--so why discuss it?\\n\\nTurning his head and staring hard at me, he continued, “There’s only one\\nthing to be considered--_her happiness_.”\\n\\n“Perhaps she’ll forget when I’m gone,” I ventured.\\n\\n“She won’t and you know it.”\\n\\nHe barked the words. His manner was losing its air of tired patience.\\n\\n“See here, Cardover, you and I have got to get down to facts. We don’t\\nhelp one another by fooling ourselves. You went out of her life for a\\nyear; she didn’t forget. It’s different now; you’ve been with her in this\\nhouse and everything will remind her of you. What are we going to do\\nabout it?”\\n\\nHe repeated his question harshly, as though demanding an instant answer.\\nWhat could I tell him?\\n\\nHe broke the miserable silence. “Ever since you talked of leaving,\\nI’ve been studying this thing out. I knew we’d have to face it, and yet\\nsomehow I hoped---- Never mind what I hoped. So you’ve nothing to say?\\nYou can’t guess what I’m driving at?”\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\nHis face became haggard and stern; only the twitching of the eye-lids\\nbetrayed his nervousness.\\n\\n“I’d give anything to see Vi happy. So would you--isn’t that correct?”\\n He darted a challenging look in my direction. “I’d give all I possess,\\nI say, factories, banks, good name, popularity. She’s more to me than\\nanything in the world.” Then reluctantly forcing himself to speak the\\nwords, “There’s only one way out--only one way to make her happy.”\\n\\nHe leant forward, clutching my knee. “You must have her.”\\n\\nI drew back from him amazed, startled out of my self-possession. There\\nwas something so horribly commonsense about his offer; I could not take\\nhim seriously for the moment. He was tempting me, perhaps, in order\\nthat he might find out just how far Vi and I had gone together--he might\\neasily suspect that things had happened during that summer at Ransby\\nwhich had not been confessed.\\n\\nNow as I met his cold gray eyes, I felt his power. His face was\\ninscrutable and set, his mouth relentless. I had often wondered as I\\nhad watched him in his home-life what stern qualities his amiability\\ndisguised--qualities which would account for his business success. I\\nknew now: here was a man who could state facts in their nudity and strip\\nproblems of their sentiment--a man who could lay aside feeling and act\\nwith the cruelty of logic.\\n\\n“You must have her,” he repeated.\\n\\n“Randall,” I broke out hoarsely, “you don’t mean that.”\\n\\n“I do mean it.”\\n\\n“She wouldn’t allow it.”\\n\\n“She’d have to if I forced her; when I’d forced her, she’d be glad.”\\n\\n“But it’s impossible. It isn’t honorable.”\\n\\n“Honorable! If we’d been honorable, you and I, this wouldn’t have\\nhappened.”\\n\\n“But think what people would say?”\\n\\n“What people would say doesn’t matter. There are some things which go so\\ndeep that they concern only ourselves.”\\n\\n“But Vi--before ever we decide anything, it would be honest to consult\\nher.”\\n\\n“You had her decision to-night.” He spoke bitterly, with settled\\nfinality. “You see it’s this way: I’ve tried to make her happy; because\\nof you I never shall. She wants you; she’s a right to have you.”\\n\\nThe fire had all but gone out; the room had grown chilly. We sat without\\ntalking, thinking of her, reviewing the brutal cruelties of life. I had\\nreached the logical goal of my desire--the impossible had happened.\\n\\nI let my fancy run a little way ahead, picturing the first freshness of\\nthe days that were coming. Far away, with faery sounds, bugles of the\\nfuture were blowing. I was recalled to the ominous present by the frozen\\nhopelessness of this just man. We were placing society at defiance; we\\nwere settling our problem on grounds of individual expediency. Would we\\nhave strength to be happy in spite of condemnation? Would our conception\\nof what was just to Vi prove just in the end?\\n\\nI began to waver. I thought I saw what had happened to Randall--the\\ntension of the last weeks had wrought upon his nerves. He had brooded\\nover the situation till remorse for his own share in it had made him\\nlose his regard for social standards. There was a tinge of insanity\\nabout this quixotic determination to sacrifice himself.\\n\\nI went over to the fireplace and pulled the smoldering logs together,\\nso that they broke into a feeble flame. I did it leisurely to gain time.\\nWith my back towards him I inquired, “Have you reckoned the cost of all\\nthis?”\\n\\n“Probably.”\\n\\n“But the cost to yourself?”\\n\\n“As far as I can.”\\n\\n“You can’t have. You wouldn’t propose it if you had. You know what’ll be\\nsaid.”\\n\\n“What’ll be said?”\\n\\n“That you wanted to get rid of her and that that was why you took me\\ninto your house.”\\n\\n“Leave me out of it. If love means anything, it means sacrifice. I love\\nher; you’ve come between us. My love’s injuring her now, and I’m not\\ngoing to see you spoil her life by going away without her.”\\n\\n“But she’ll spoil her life if she goes with me. People----”\\n\\n“People! Well, what’ll they say about her?”\\n\\n“Everything defiling that hasn’t occurred.”\\n\\n“And _you_ think that we ought to keep her miserable just because of\\nthat--out of fear of tittle-tattle? If she stays with me she’ll be\\nwretched; I shall have to watch myself torturing her--paining her even\\nwith my affection. If she goes with you----”\\n\\n“If she goes with me she’ll become a social outcast. She couldn’t bear\\nthat; she’d sink under it. No, Randall, we can’t decide this matter\\nas if it concerned only ourselves. It doesn’t. There are all kinds\\nof things involved in it. I’ve been your guest, and you’ve become my\\nfriend. We’d look low-down in other people’s eyes. You want her to be\\nhappy--none of us could ever be that if we did what you suggest. Don’t\\nyou see that you’d be the only one who was playing a decent part? Vi’s\\npart and mine would be contemptible. We’d appear treacherous even to\\nourselves. As for other people----!! You take me into your house when\\nI’m sick, and I run off with your wife! It can’t be done, Randall.”\\n\\n“But that’s not what I’m proposing,” he said quietly; “I don’t want you\\nto run away together.”\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n“I’ll arrange that she shall divorce me. I’ve consulted lawyers.\\nAccording to the laws of Massachusetts an absolute divorce, which would\\npermit you to marry her within a reasonable time, is only granted on\\none ground. I’ll provide her with fictitious evidence. She can bring the\\ncase against me and I’ll let it go uncontested. She can win her freedom\\nrespectably without your name being mentioned.”\\n\\nMy position was elaborately false. I wanted her with every atom of my\\nbody, and here was I contending that I would not have her. At Ransby I\\nhad been willing to steal her, and now she was offered me; but I had not\\nseen how much she meant to Randall then--at that time he was a hostile\\nfigure in my imagination.\\n\\nHis unselfishness filled me with shame that I had ever thought to wrong\\nhim. And yet the thing which he proposed was the inevitable consequence\\nof our actions; his cold reasoning had discerned that. If facts were as\\nhe had stated them, what other way was there out?\\n\\n“You agree, then?”\\n\\n“I don’t. You’d save our faces for us, but what d’you suppose we’d think\\nof ourselves? The thing’s not decent. People don’t do things like that.\\nMen can run off with other men’s wives and still respect themselves;\\nif they did what you suggest--take the husband’s happiness and his good\\nname as well--they’d know what to call themselves, though no one else\\nsuspected.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“Blackguards.”\\n\\n“So in your opinion it’s worse to take a wife with her husband’s consent\\nthan to steal her? Humph!”\\n\\nHe leant across the table for a cigar. With great deliberation he\\ncut the end. When it was well alight, he thrust his thumbs into his\\nwaistcoat pockets, looking me up and down. When he spoke, he left gaps\\nbetween his words. There was the rumble of suppressed anger in what he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“I thought you were a strong man, Cardover, or I shouldn’t have spoken\\nto you the way I have. You fell in love with my wife without knowing\\nshe was married; I don’t blame you for that. But after you knew, you\\nfollowed her--followed her to her home-town. You’ve made an impossible\\nsituation. You can’t leave it at that; you’ve got to help out, and,\\nby God, you shall. I’ve got to lose her and stand the disgrace of it.\\nYou’ve got to lose your self-respect. What d’you think life is, anyhow?\\nIf you gamble, you incur debts. We’re going to play this game to a\\nfinish. You talk of decency and honor; you should have thought of them\\nearlier. You came here to rob me of my wife; well, now I’m going to\\ngive her to you because she can’t do without you. And now, out of\\nconsideration for me, you want to crawl out at the last minute. Your\\ncrawling out may save appearances, but it don’t alter facts. You’re\\nsomething worse than a blackguard--a quitter.”\\n\\nHe drew in his breath as if he were about to strike; then he flung out\\nhis fist, shaking it at me. “Don’t you want her?”\\n\\n“You know I want her.”\\n\\n“Then what’s the matter? Are you afraid of the price?”\\n\\n“The price she’d have to pay and you’d have to pay--yes.”\\n\\nHe frowned. His face was puckered with suspicion. “Isn’t it that you’re\\nafraid for yourself?”\\n\\nThe heat of his anger scorched me. I had watched this interpretation of\\nmy conduct taking shape under my repeated refusals.\\n\\n“I’ve been accused of counting the cost before to-day,” I said. “I’m not\\ncounting the cost now. I’m thinking of Vi with her clean standards\\nand her sense of duty. If she were the woman to consent to what you’re\\nproposing, I wouldn’t want to marry her and you wouldn’t be willing to\\nsacrifice yourself for her. But she won’t consent, and I won’t consent.”\\n\\nLurching heavily to his feet, he stood over me threateningly. “Don’t you\\nknow I can force you? If I divorced her you’d have to marry her.”\\n\\n“But you won’t.”\\n\\n“But I would if I thought it was only for my sake you were refusing.”\\n\\n“It’s only partly for your sake.”\\n\\n“Why, then?”\\n\\n“I’ve shared your hospitality.”\\n\\n“And because of that you won’t take her?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then I’ll make you---- For the last time, will you take her?”\\n\\n“Not on those terms.”\\n\\nOur voices had risen. A silence followed. Behind us we heard a sound.\\nThe temperature of the room seemed lowered, as though something we had\\nkilled had entered.\\n\\nTurning, we saw Vi standing in the doorway. Her hair fell loose about\\nher shoulders. She was thinly clad and had risen hastily from bed. Our\\nquarrel must have reached her through the silent house. Her face was\\npinched and pitiful. As she watched us her eyes searched Randall’s in\\nterror and her hands plucked at her breasts.\\n\\nHow much had she heard? How long had she been standing there? Did she\\nknow how we had been degrading her? What had she gathered from my last\\nwords? She had found us haggling over her as though she were a chattel,\\neach one trying to force the other to accept her, neither showing any\\nsign that he desired her for himself. In the chilly room we shivered,\\nhanging our heads.\\n\\nSlowly she crossed the room. Her eyes were fixed on Randall; for all the\\nattention she paid me, I might not have been there.\\n\\n“You didn’t mean it. You can’t have meant it.”\\n\\nHe lifted his head weakly, in one last effort to be firm.\\n\\n“But I did, Vi. It’s for your sake--for your happiness.”\\n\\nShe flung her arms about him, holding him to her though he tried to draw\\nback.\\n\\n“But you forgot----”\\n\\n“I forgot nothing.”\\n\\n“You did--there’s Dorrie.”\\n\\nShe buried her head on his shoulder, sobbing her heart out. He eyed\\nme sullenly. He looked an old man. Awkwardly, with a gesture that was\\nafraid of its tenderness, he let his hand wander across her hair. She\\nraised her face to his, clinging against him, and kissed him on the\\nmouth.\\n\\nThey traversed the room, going from me; their footsteps died out upon\\nthe stairs.\\n\\nNever once had she looked at me.\\n\\nIn the grayness of the morning, before the servants had begun to stir, I\\npacked my bag and left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK IV--THE FRUIT OF THE GARDEN\\n\\n\\n_Thou hast been in Eden. Thou shalt eat the fruit of thy doings, yea,\\neven the fruit of thy thoughts._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I--THE HOME-COMING\\n\\nLeaving the hansom at the foot of Pope Lane and carrying my bags, I\\nwalked up the avenue of limes. The wantonness of spring was in the air\\nand its melancholy. Above the high walls the golden hurry of the sunset\\nquivered. A breeze tore past me down the passage, twisting and turning\\nlike a madcap ballet-dancer. Overhead in the young greenness of\\nthe trees a host of sparrows fluttered, impudently publishing their\\nlove-making.\\n\\nAt Plymouth on landing I had been met by letters from my lawyers and\\nfrom Uncle Obad. They were addressed to Sir Dante Cardover. It was\\nrather pleasant to be addressed as Sir Dante; until then I had not\\nrealized my luck. The memory of that last night at Sheba had numbed\\nmy faculties and taken my future from me. But now, with the thought of\\nWoadley, life began to weave itself into a new pattern.\\n\\nOn the run up to London, as the quiet of English landscapes and the\\ngreenness of English meadows drifted by, I lost my bitter sense of\\nisolation: I belonged to this; it was part of me. At the same time, the\\nimpassive wholesomeness of English faces awoke me in a strange way to\\nthe enormity of what I had done. It was odd how far I had wandered from\\nold traditions and old landmarks in the delirium of the past two years.\\nEven I was a little scandalized by some of my recollections.\\n\\nNext day I purposed to go down to Woadley; to-night I would spend with\\nmy father at Pope Lane. There were explanations to be made; explanations\\nwhere my father was concerned, were never comfortable. I walked with a\\npebble in my shoe till I had got them over. I had sure proof that he was\\nannoyed, for none of my letters, written to him since my recovery, had\\nbeen answered.\\n\\nThrusting my hand into the creeper, I found the knob. Far away at the\\nback of the house the bell tinkled; after an interval footsteps shuffled\\ndown the path. The door opened cautiously; in the slit it made I saw the\\nface of Hetty. There was something in its expression that warned me.\\n\\n“Father at home?” I asked cheerfully, pushing forward.\\n\\n“Master Dante, or Sir Dante as I should say, don’t you go for to see\\n’im.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“’E’s bitter against you.”\\n\\n“What nonsense! Here, take one of these bags. Why should he be bitter\\nagainst me?”\\n\\nShe crumpled her apron nervously. “’Cause of ’er--the woman in\\nAmeriky. I don’t know the rights of it, but ’e’s ’ardly spoke your\\nname since.”\\n\\n“But I’ve come to see him. I’ve only just landed.”\\n\\nShe stared at me gloomily, barring the entrance. Across her shoulder I\\ncould see the path winding round the house and down to the garden where\\neverything was familiar. Once I had longed to leave it! How much I would\\nnow give to get back! The leaves shivered, making patches of sunlight\\nmove like gold checkers, pushed forward and backward on the lawn. My\\nmind keenly visualized all the details that lay out of sight. I knew\\njust how my father must look sitting writing at his study-window. I\\nought to have told him; he might have understood. But the barrier of\\nreticence had always divided us.\\n\\n“If I was you, Sir Dante, I’d go away and write ’im. I’ll see that\\n’e reads it this time. Yes I will, if I loses my plaice.”\\n\\n“_This time?_”\\n\\nHer cheeks went crimson. “’E didn’t read the letters you sent\\nafter ’ers. ’E tossed ’em aside.”\\n\\n“But the Snow Lady and Ruthie, they’ll see me.”\\n\\nShe looked furtively over her shoulder at the house, then she slipped\\nout into the lane beside me, almost closing the door.\\n\\n“There ain’t no Miss Ruthie now,” she said sadly. Then, in a voice which\\nbetrayed pride, “She’s Lady Halloway. ’Is Lordship, ’e were a wery\\n’ot lover, ’e were--wouldn’t take no for an answer and suchlike.\\nAfter you’d gone away angry and no one knew where you’d gone, Miss\\nRuthie felt kind o’ flat; but she kept on sayin’ no to ’is Lordship,\\nthough she was always cryin’. Then that letter came from Americky. It\\nkind o’ took us by surprise; Miss Ruthie especially. We felt--well,\\nyou know, sir--disrespectable. So she gave way like, and now she’s Lady\\nHalloway. And there you are. We’ve ’ad a ’eap of trouble.”\\n\\nLittle Ruthie the wife of that man! I had made them unrespectable, so\\nshe had rectified my mistake by marrying the father of Lottie’s child!\\n\\n“You’d better write.”\\n\\nShe had edged herself into the garden and held the door at\\nclosing-point. I could see the house no longer. Her head looked out\\nthrough the slit as though it had no body. I was sick and angry--angry\\nbecause of Ruthita. Anger restored my determination. They should not\\ncondemn me without a hearing; their morality was stucco-fronted--a cheap\\nimitation of righteousness.\\n\\nI pushed roughly past Hetty like an insolent peddler, and left her\\nbleating protests behind. In the hall I dropped my bags and entered my\\nfather’s study unannounced.\\n\\nHe glanced up from under the hand with which his eyes were shaded. His\\nmouth straightened. He went on with his writing, feigning that he had\\nnot heard me enter. I remembered the trick well--as a boy it had made\\npunishment the more impressive. It was done for that purpose now; he had\\nnever accustomed himself to think of me as a grown man.\\n\\nI watched him. How lean, and threadbare, and overworked he looked! How\\nhe tyrannized over himself! The hair had grown thin about the temples;\\nhis eyes were weak, his forehead lined. He had disciplined joy out of\\nhis life. But there was something big about him--a stern forcefulness of\\ncharacter which came of long years of iron purpose. He had failed, but\\nhe would not acknowledge his failure. All these years his daily routine\\nof drudgery had remained unchanged. Outside the spring was stirring,\\njust as it had stirred in his children’s lives. But his windows were\\nshut against the spring because he had to earn his daily bread. The\\nanger I had felt turned to pity. He was so lonely in his strength. Had\\nhe been weaker, he would have been happier.\\n\\n“You did not want to see me?”\\n\\nHe blotted his page carefully and laid aside his pen. “I had good\\nreason.” His voice was cold and tired.\\n\\n“You can’t judge of that; you haven’t heard.”\\n\\n“I can conjecture.”\\n\\n“But I have at least the right to explain. You can’t conjecture the\\ndetails that led up to it.”\\n\\n“These things are usually led up to by the same details. All I know is\\nthat any meeting between us now can only cause pain, and I cannot afford\\nto be upset. You have your standards of honor; I have mine. Evidently\\nthey are divergent. You didn’t give me your confidence before you\\nsailed; I don’t invite it now.”\\n\\nHe had allowed me to remain standing, making me feel my intrusion on his\\nprivacy. I had always felt that in talking to him I was keeping him from\\nhis work. My mind went back to the fear with which I had entered his\\nstudy in the old days. And this was the end of it.\\n\\n“You can never have cared much for me,” I threw out bitterly, “if you\\ncan break with me so lightly.”\\n\\nHis pale face flushed; his distant manner broke down. “How should you\\nknow how much I cared?”\\n\\n“How should I know! All my life you’ve been silent and there were\\ntimes----”\\n\\nHe interrupted. “It is because I cared so much. I was so anxious for you\\nand wanted you to do so well. I’m not demonstrative. I always hoped that\\nwe might be friends. But you never came to me with your troubles from a\\nlittle chap, anyone was better than your father--servants, your Uncle\\nSpreckles, Ruthita, anybody. With me you were dumb.”\\n\\n“You never encouraged my confidence and now you condemn me unheard.\\nSilence between us has become a habit.”\\n\\nHe stabbed the blotting-paper with his pen. His emotions were stirred;\\nhe was afraid he might betray them. So he spoke hurriedly. “It’s too\\nlate to cover old ground. We’ve drifted apart, that’s certain--and now\\nthis has happened... this disgrace... this adultery of thoughts... this\\nlust for a married woman.”\\n\\nI walked across to the window and drummed upon the panes. Across the\\ngarden a soft gray dusk was falling. Along those paths Ruthita and I\\nhad played; the garden was empty and very lonely. Scene after scene came\\nback, made kindly by distance. I turned. “Father, I’m not going to let\\nyou turn me out until you know all about it. For the first time you’ve\\ntold me frankly that you wanted me. I was always frightened as a little\\nchap.”\\n\\nInstead of taking me up angrily as I expected, he spoke gently. “Why\\nshouldn’t I want you? I thought you’d understand by the way I worked.\\nSit down, boy; why are you standing? How... how did it happen?”\\n\\nThe Snow Lady rapped on the door and almost entered. My father signed to\\nher to go away, saying that we would come to her later. Then I told him.\\nAnd while I told him I kept thinking how strange it was that until now,\\nwhen we had quarreled, we should never have found one another, but, like\\ntwo people eager to meet, had walked always at the same pace, in the\\nsame direction, out of sight, round and round on opposite sides of the\\nsame house.\\n\\nIt was dark when I finished. He leant out and laid his hand on my arm.\\n“And now that it’s all ended, we can make a new start together.”\\n\\n“It may not be all ended.”\\n\\n“But it is. You’re not going to tell me that you’re still hankering\\nafter a married woman?”\\n\\n“I am.”\\n\\nThe kindness went from his voice. He rang the bell, waited in silence\\ntill Hetty brought the lamp, and took it from her at the door to prevent\\nher entering.\\n\\n“You say it isn’t ended, this criminal folly. I can’t conceive what\\nyou mean by it. One of these days you’ll drag my name through the\\ndirt. There are other people to consider besides yourself. There’s\\nRuthita--her husband’s sensitive already. In fact, he doesn’t want to\\nmeet you, and he doesn’t want you to meet her. What it comes to is this:\\nwe can’t be friends unless you give this woman up absolutely.”\\n\\n“It’s not possible. Randall threatened to divorce her. If he does, it\\nwill be that I may marry her. I shall have to marry her, and I shall be\\njolly glad to marry her. What has happened since I left I can’t tell.\\nUntil I know, I hold myself prepared. So I can’t promise anything.”\\n\\n“The choice is between her and your family.”\\n\\n“I choose her.”\\n\\n“Then until you’ve come to your senses, there can be no communication\\nbetween us.”\\n\\nHe sat down noisily at his desk. “You’ll excuse me; there’s nothing more\\nto be said.”\\n\\nWhen I still waited, he took up his pen. “I have an article here that I\\nmust get finished.”\\n\\nI walked slowly down the lane. The door swung to behind me. I felt\\nthat I was seeing this for the last time. All the old, trivial, sweet\\nassociations came thronging back: the dying affections, the lost\\ninnocence which had seemed so permanent, stretched out hands to restrain\\nme. Even Hetty had condemned; it was written in her face. Long ago Hetty\\nand I had viewed the world from the same angle, we had criticised and\\nschemed against our tyrants together. The chapter of home life was\\nended. Whatever happened as regards Vi, there could be no going back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II--DREAM HAVEN\\n\\nI did not go to Woadley as I had planned. My position was too uncertain\\nat present for me to venture where further explanations would be\\nrequired. My father had made me aware of that. I was unwilling to cover\\nthe same ground of argument with Grandmother Cardover, so I had my\\nlawyers visit me in London.\\n\\nUntil something had been definitely settled, I did not care to return to\\nOxford or to seek out any of my friends; I should at once be called upon\\nto account for my erratic departure and prolonged absence. So I made\\nmyself inconspicuous in the crowds of London, waiting for some final\\nword from Sheba. It was quite likely that none would ever come--and that\\nwould be an answer in itself. Yet, now that I had done what had seemed\\nto me right and had thrust her from me, I hoped against hope that,\\nsomehow, she might come back. I felt that though I might have to wait\\nfor years, I would resolutely wait for her. No other woman could ever\\ntake her place. And none of this could I tell her. She might think that\\nI had counted the cost and considered it too expensive. She might put\\nthe worst construction on the words she had overheard on that last\\nnight; yet unless she approached me first, I was irrevocably pledged to\\nsilence.\\n\\nToo late for my peace of mind I recognized my weakness: if I had wanted\\nher, I should have taken her strongly in the early days and faced\\nthe consequences; now, through making truces with my conscience and\\nconventions, I had lived so long in thoughts of her that I should always\\ndesire her.\\n\\nI would like to have gone to Ruthita, but that was forbidden. Lord\\nHalloway riding the high horse of morality was exceedingly comic, but\\nI knew exactly how men of his stamp argued: to introduce a questionable\\nrelation into the family was anathema. I wondered continually what\\nsecret causes lay behind Ruthita’s marriage. I felt sure that she had\\nconsented on the impulse, and that love had had nothing to do with it.\\nThe suspicion that I was somehow responsible left me worried.\\n\\nSpring had reached the point of perfection where it merges into summer.\\nThe tides of life flowed strongly through the dazzling streets of\\nLondon; I was too young not to respond to their energy. Everywhere the\\npersistent hope of spring planted banners of green and set them waving.\\nRagged shrubs in decrepit squares bubbled into blossom. Window-boxes\\nlent a touch of braveness. Water-carts passed up and down parched\\nstreets, settling the dust. In the kind of suburb that walks always with\\na hole in its stocking, slatternly maids pressed their bosoms against\\narea-railings chaffing with butcher-boy or policeman--their idea of\\nlove. Where a street-organ struck up, little children gathered, dancing\\nin the gutter. Even the sullen Thames, the gray hair of London, was dyed\\nto gold between the bridges by the splendid sun. The spirit of youth had\\ninvaded the city; flower-girls, shouting raucously above the traffic,\\nshaking their posies in the face of every comer, seemed heralds of a new\\ncheerfulness, shaming Despair of his defiance.\\n\\nThis severing of oneself from friendship was dull. Leisurely crowds\\nlaughing along sunlit pavements, made me ache for companionship. I was\\nin this frame of mind when I chanced to think of Uncle Obad’s letter.\\nIt had met me at Plymouth on my arrival, and bore the characteristically\\nflamboyant address of _Dream Haven, Dorking._\\n\\nHe must have chosen Dorking as a place of residence because it had\\ngiven its name to a famous breed of fowls. Perhaps he thought such a\\nneighborhood would be propitious to his own experiments. His letter was\\nbrief and to the point: if I could spare the time, he and Aunt Lavinia\\nwould feel honored to entertain me.\\n\\nUncle Obad was stilted in his written use of language; he felt _honored_\\nwhen he meant to say _jolly well glad_. There was always an obedient\\nservant ring about the way in which he signed himself. The training he\\nhad undergone as secretary to charitable societies had spoilt him for\\nfamiliar letter-writing.\\n\\nSince the Rapson incident, things had never been quite the same. My\\ngood fortune made him uneasy; it placed a gap between us and, I suppose,\\nserved to emphasize his non-success. Of his new mode of life since\\nthe Christian Boarding House had been abandoned, I had only heard. The\\nthought of him had lain a dusty memory at the back of my mind--which\\nmade it all the kinder that he should now remember me. Perhaps he had\\nheard before writing of how Pope Lane had planned to receive me.\\n\\nAs I steamed into the station I hung my head out of the window to catch\\nfirst sight of him. Yes, there he was. He had grown stouter; his purple\\nwhiskers which still bristled like shaving-brushes, had faded to a milky\\nwhite. He was wearing a long fawn dust-coat which flapped about the\\ncalves of his legs. He carried the old exaggerated air of blustering\\nimportance, but was a trifle more careless in his dress. His\\ncarelessness, however, was now the prosperous untidiness of one who\\ncould afford it. In his lapel he wore a scarlet geranium.\\n\\nAs I stepped out, he came fussily towards me. “Very good of you to come,\\nI’m sure--kind and very thoughtful.”\\n\\nIt was his pretense manner--the one he adopted with grown-ups. I wanted\\nto remind him that with me he could take off his armor.\\n\\n“Still go in for breeding hens?” I asked him.\\n\\nHis face brightened. “I should say so. Our little place is quite a\\nmenagerie. We’ve cats, and dogs, and rabbits, and a parrot. And hens!\\nWell, I should say so.”\\n\\n“_And hens_,” I laughed. “Remember the old white hen you gave me? It\\nlaid one egg and then ate it; after that it died.”\\n\\n“Should have given it gravel or oyster-shells.” Poultryraising was a\\nsubject he never treated lightly. He fussed along beside me, explaining\\nwith his old enthusiasm the mysterious ways of fowls.\\n\\nOutside the station a dog-cart was standing, with a fat little piebald\\npony between the shafts. We stuffed the baggage under the back-seat, and\\nsqueezed into the front together. The pony started off at a smart trot.\\n\\n“D’you know what this reminds me of?--That first day we spent together.\\nYou remember--when you drove me away from Pope Lane behind Dollie?”\\n\\nHe pulled out his handkerchief and trumpeted. His eyes became dreamy\\nbeneath his bushy brows. “A long time ago! They were good days, but not\\nas good as these, old chap.”\\n\\nWe fell to remembering. The pony slowed down to a walk. How everything\\ncame back as we talked! And how ripping the old Spuffler had always\\nbeen, and how ripping it was to be near him now! He had put aside his\\narmor of pretense and was talking naturally. We talked together of that\\nfirst day when we had met the gipsies in the Surrey woodland, and we\\ntalked of the Red House, and of all the times that we had been happy. A\\nwarm wind fluttered about us. I caught Uncle Obad looking at me fixedly,\\ndropping his eyes and then looking up again, as though he were trying to\\nsatisfy himself.\\n\\n“That _Sir_ don’t seem to have spoiled you.”\\n\\nThe red walls of Dorking were left behind. A white chalky road stretched\\nbefore us, climbing upward to the skyey downs; over to the left rose a\\nwooded ridge, somnolent with pines; to the right lay a village-common\\nacross which geese waddled in solemn procession.\\n\\nUncle Obad roused himself and shook the reins. “This won’t buy a pair of\\nshoes for the baby. Aunt Lavinia’s waiting for us; she’s just as keen as\\nI was to see whether you’ve altered.” Then to the pony, “Gee-up, Toby.”\\n\\nWe turned off into the pine-wood by a narrow roadway. The fragrance of\\nbalsam made me long to close my eyes. At the edge of the road, on either\\nside, ran a ditch through which water tinkled over gravel. On its banks\\ngrew fern and foxglove. The silent aisles of the wood were carpeted with\\nthe tan of fallen needles. Sunlight, drifting between branches, slashed\\ngolden rags in the olive-tinted shadows. My mind became a blank through\\npure enjoyment as I listened to the monologue of gay chatter that was\\ngoing on beside me. He was doing for me now just what he had done for me\\nso often as a child, throwing down the walls of conventional tyrannies\\nand showing me the road of escape to nature.\\n\\nSuddenly out of the basking stillness rose a farmyard clamor--cocks\\ncrowing, ducks quacking, and the boastful clucking of hens. We had\\nreached the top of the ridge and were bowling along the level. Toby\\npricked up his ears and quickened his trotting. Round a bend we swung\\ninto sight of a low-thatched house, standing in a clearing. Its windows\\nwere leaded and opened outwards. In front grew a garden, sun-saturated,\\nriotous with flowers, and partly hidden by a high hawthorn hedge. In the\\nhedge was a white swing-gate, from which a red-brick path ran up to the\\nthreshold. Across the gate one had a glimpse of beehives standing a-row;\\nthe air was heavy with mingled scents of pine, wild thyme, and honey.\\nThe impression that fastened on my imagination was one of exquisite\\ncleanliness: the sky, the gleaming chalk road, the white-painted\\nwoodwork of the cottage, everything was dazzlingly spotless.\\n\\nOur wheels had hardly halted before the gate, when I saw Aunt Lavinia\\nin the doorway unfastening her apron. Neat and methodical as ever, she\\nfolded it carefully, and laid it on a chair before coming out to us.\\n\\n“Lavinia, Lavinia! We’re here,” shouted Uncle Obad.\\n\\nShe came down the path, prim and unhurried, determined not to let\\nherself go. “Repose is refinement” she used to tell me. Nothing in her\\nmanner was ruffled. She still carried herself with a certain grave air\\nof sweet authority. The rustle of her starched print-dress gave her an\\natmosphere of nurse-like austerity. She had not changed, save that the\\nlook of worry had gone from her face, and her eyes were untired.\\n\\n“It’s glad I am to see you.” She spoke quietly and, when she kissed me,\\nwas careful not to crumple her dress.\\n\\n“Dignified and graceful--that’s her,” said Uncle Obad.\\n\\nWe had plenty to talk about while we were getting over our first\\nstrangeness. I had to see the house and all its arrangements. My room\\nwas at the back, looking out from the ridge over smoking tree-tops far\\naway across undulating downs.\\n\\nWindows and doors were always open, so the passages were blowy with the\\ndreamy, drowsy smell of green things growing. Creepers tumbled across\\nsills; leaves tapped whenever the breeze stirred them; pigeons flew\\ninto the dining-room at meal-times and perched on Uncle Obad’s shoulder.\\nUsually everything within a house is man-made. At Dream Haven Nature was\\nencouraged to tiptoe across the threshold; so bees entered humming,\\nand blackbirds came for grain to the windows, and all day long the wild\\nthings were sending their ambassadors. Beating wings of birds and cooing\\nof doves filled one’s ears with the peace and adventure of contentment.\\n\\nThese were the recreations of Dream Haven, but its stern business, as\\none might suppose, was the raising of fowls. At the back of the cottage\\non a southern <DW72> were arranged coops, and pens, and houses, gleaming\\nwhite against the golden gravel like a miniature military encampment.\\nEach pen had its trumpeter, who strode forth at intervals to raise his\\nchallenge; whereupon every male in camp tried to outdo him, from the\\nyoungest stripling, whose shrill falsetto broke like a boy’s voice in\\nthe middle, to the deep, rich tones of the oldest campaigner. Falsetto,\\ntenor, bass, baritone shook the stillness like an army on the\\nmarch, with rattle of accoutrements, and brass-bands playing,\\n_cock-a-doodle-doo, cock-a-doodle-doo_.\\n\\nIn the hush that followed from far away, as from scattered detachments\\nreplying, came the counter-sign. Below the ridge in the village on the\\ndowns every rooster felt his reputation endangered. In farmhouses out\\nof sight the challenge was caught up and the boast flung back. To one\\nlistening intently, the clamor could be heard spreading across the\\ncountryside till it spent itself at last in the hazy distance.\\nThen the ladies of the camp commenced their flatteries,\\n_tuck-tuck-tuck-tuck-tuck-tuck, our men did best, our men did best_.\\n\\nUncle Obad took childish delight in the comedy; he knew the voice of\\neach male bird in his yard and the sequence of precedence in which they\\nshould aspire. If they got out of order, he would recognize at once\\nwhich cockerel was trying to oust his senior. If the ambitious fellow\\nwas one of his experiments in crossing strains, he was vastly tickled.\\nTo him they all had their personalities; he used to say that a\\npoultry-yard could teach you a whole lot about humans.\\n\\n“Why don’t you men go out for a walk?” said Aunt Lavinia; “I’m sure\\nDante would like to look about.”\\n\\nShe knew that we had always had our secrets. It was seven o’clock; there\\nwere still some hours of daylight. We set off through the poultry-runs\\ndown the hillside till we came to the edge of the clearing; Uncle Obad\\nlooked round furtively to make sure that we were unobserved, then he\\nbeckoned and slipped behind a shed. There he sat down with his back\\nagainst the warm wooden wall and we lit our pipes. “She makes me take\\nexercise now,” he grunted between puffs; “thinks I’m getting fat.”\\n\\n“Perhaps she’s right. Aunt Lavinia’s always been right ever since I can\\nremember.”\\n\\n“I should say so. She doesn’t look it, but she’s always worn the\\ntrousers, and small blame to her. But she was wrong once.”\\n\\n“When was that?”\\n\\nHe narrowed his eyes and watched the smoke curl up into the velvet air.\\nWhen it had drifted a few yards away, one could imagine that it was a\\ngalleon cloud sailing slowly through infinity. I got to thinking how\\nmuch more picturesque the world becomes when we lose our standards of\\nperspective. Uncle Obad had won his happiness by making small things\\nimportant to himself.\\n\\nHe did not answer my question. I was too lazy to trouble him again. The\\nrich spicy fragrance of woodlands lulled my senses. I watched through a\\ngap in the trees how the sun’s rays shortened across the downs. All the\\nout-door world was bathed in tepid light. The fierceness had gone out of\\nthe day.\\n\\nThe Spuffler always made me philosophize; he was a failure, but he had\\nfound a secret. He had known how to discover nooks and crannies in\\nthe persistent present where he could be content. I had lost that fine\\nfaculty for carelessness since I had grown older.\\n\\nHe knocked out his pipe and commenced to refill it. “But she wasn’t\\nalways right,” he chuckled. “I may be only an old knacker, but once\\nI was righter than her.--What d’you think of all this?” He jerked his\\nthumb across his shoulder.\\n\\n“It’s the last word... just what we always dreamt.”\\n\\n“That’s why I called it Dream Haven. Not so bad for a man of my years\\nafter keeping a Christian Boarding House!”\\n\\n“Make it pay?”\\n\\n“Not yet. Don’t need to, by Golly.”\\n\\n“Don’t need to! How’s that?”\\n\\n“Business knowledge. Sound judgment. Backing my opinion when the odds\\nwere against me. I doubled up my fists and stood square against the\\nworld.”\\n\\n“A kind of brave Horatius?”\\n\\n“Who’s he?”\\n\\n“Kept the bridge or something. Was a friend of Macaulay.”\\n\\n“Never heard of him. Did he keep poultry?”\\n\\n“May have done; he was the kind of man who’d keep anything he laid his\\nhands on. But how the dickens d’you hang on to this place if it isn’t\\npaying?”\\n\\n“Got money. Got money to burn. Got enough to last me to my journey’s end\\nwithout earning a penny.”\\n\\nHe was a small boy boasting. What a lot of fun he’d have extracted from\\nbeing Squire of Woadley. I wished I might learn how to spuffle; it\\nso multiplied one’s opportunities for pleasure. But I couldn’t get\\nas excited as he expected; I had heard him talk this way before on a\\ncertain day at Richmond.\\n\\n“Did you make it out of the boarding-house?” I inquired incredulously.\\n\\nHe laughed deep down in his throat. “Not exactly. I received an\\nenvelope one morning; inside was a slip of paper on which was written\\n‘_Compensation for a damaged character_’ There was no address.”\\n\\n“But there must have been more than that.”\\n\\n“You bet. There was a banker’s draft. How much for? Guess.”\\n\\n“Can’t guess.”\\n\\n“Five thousand pounds.”\\n\\n“Whoof! One of your charitable bigwigs sent it?”\\n\\n“Not half. Came from Rapson. That’s what comes of sticking to your\\nfriends. That’s why I say that your Aunt wasn’t always wiser than the\\npoor old knacker.”\\n\\n“Mines?”\\n\\n“So he said. He’s been to see me since then. The way your Aunt Lavinia\\ntreated him was as funny as a cock without feathers.--I always believed\\nin Rapson.--He had a bad streak though.”\\n\\n“Which one?”\\n\\nHe passed over my slur. “Women.”\\n\\n“Kitty?”\\n\\n“That’s what I meant. He’s sorry now; wishes he’d married her.”\\n\\n“Humph! If you don’t make your place pay, what are you doing?”\\n\\nHis face took on an expression of intense earnestness.\\n\\n“Breeding the Spreckles. Remember them, don’t you? I had terrible work\\nat first; couldn’t make the strain permanent; in the third and fourth\\ngenerations it was always going back to the original crossings. Well,\\nnow I’ve done it. Come and look at ’em.”\\n\\nThe old bond was established. His enthusiasm and my response to it swept\\naside the misunderstandings of years. I seemed a little boy, following\\nhim into a retreat of impossible glamour. He showed me a pen of\\nmagnificent slate-blue fowls; they had the extra toe of the Dorking, the\\ndrooping comb of the Leghorn, yellow legs of the Game, and full plump\\nbody of the Plymouth Rock. He enumerated their merits, insisted that\\nI should guess what mixings of blood had gone to their making, and was\\ndelighted when he found I had not forgotten the old knowledge he had\\ntaught me. He was going to enter them at the shows this year, but he was\\nworried over one point--what name should he call them?\\n\\n“But you’ve given them their name.”\\n\\n“I know, I know, old chap; but my conscience troubles me. Yer see, I\\nshouldn’t have been able to do it if it hadn’t been for Rapson. I think\\nI ought to call ’em the _Rapsons_.”\\n\\n“If you feel like that, why don’t you?”\\n\\n“He won’t let me.”\\n\\n“Share the glory then. Call ’em _Spreckles_ in public, and _Rapsons_\\namong ourselves.”\\n\\nHis simple old face lit up. “Believe you’ve solved it.” We returned to\\nour place by the shed, from which we could watch the haze of evening\\ndrifting across the billowy uplands. In the village at our feet, cattle\\nwere being driven home lowing to the milking. On the common boys were\\nplaying cricket; their laughter came to us softened by distance.\\n\\n“What made you ask me?” I said.\\n\\n“Ask you? Ask you what?”\\n\\n“To come and visit you.”\\n\\n“Why shouldn’t I?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. But I’m not popular at Pope Lane at present; I believe\\nyou know the reason. Grandmother Cardover must have told Aunt Lavinia\\nthat this was going to happen. That was why you sent that letter to the\\nship to meet me.”\\n\\nHe looked shy and awkward, and drew his hat down over his brows; I knew\\nthat he was making up his mind not to answer.\\n\\n“When I was a boy,” I continued, “I always felt that I could come to\\nyou frankly. You, somehow, understood before anything had been said. I\\nthought, perhaps, you might have understood this time, and that that was\\nwhy you asked me.”\\n\\nHe threw his arm across my shoulder. “I did, old chap. But you’ve grown\\nolder and, since you’ve got all this book-learning and all these grand\\nfriends, I kind o’ felt I was a stranger--thought you didn’t need me\\nlike you used to.”\\n\\n“My grand friends and book-learning won’t help me this turn,” I grumbled\\nslowly. “I may need you pretty badly--perhaps, more than ever I did.\\nYou’ve heard?”\\n\\n“Umph!”\\n\\n“What d’you think about it?”\\n\\n“It doesn’t much matter what an old knacker thinks about anything.”\\n\\n“Why on earth d’you keep calling yourself an old knacker?”\\n\\n“Dunno. It’s amusin’. It’s a kind o’ luxury after spuffling all my life\\nto be able at last to depreciate one’s self. Everything’s amusin’.\\nI know you are; I suppose I am; there’s no doubt about your father.\\nNothing’s overserious in this gay old world. Mustn’t take things to\\nheart, old chap. Look at me, what I’ve come through. Here I am and\\nnot much the worse for wear--battered, but useful, yours truly Obadiah\\nSpreckles, successful breeder of an entirely new strain of perpetually\\nlaying hens.” He gave himself a resounding whack upon the chest and\\ncocked his eye at me.\\n\\n“What do I think about you and the lady in America? Speaking as the\\nex-proprietor of a Christian Boarding House, I think it’s shocking.\\nSpeaking as a man of leisure, I think it’s confoundedly human. Speaking\\nas a shipwrecked cabin-boy who’s suddenly been promoted to captain, I\\nshould say that it’s one of life’s ups and downs. There’s no accounting\\nfor how love takes a man; it’s as fluky as settings of eggs--all cocks\\none day, all hens tomorrow, and the day after that nothing. Dash my\\nboots, I sometimes think that nobody’s to blame for anything. Love’s\\nshocking or interesting, according to your fancy. Take Lavinia and\\nmyself. I haven’t made her a good husband. I’ve been a failure and a\\nslacker. I’ve made her happy now only by an accident. People look at\\nus and wonder what we find in one another. They don’t know--can’t see\\nbeneath the surface. We never had any children. It’s been hard fighting.\\nBut I swear she’s never regretted.--Aye, it’s wonderful the pains God\\ntakes to bring a man and a woman together. These things ain’t accidents.\\nIf you’re meant to have her, you may have to wait, but nothing can\\nstop you--just like me and my fowls. Life’s a _leading_. ‘He leadeth me\\nbeside the still waters,’ eh, what! But it’s often rough treading till\\nyou get there.--That’s all I have to say about it, old chap.”\\n\\n“The door of Pope Lane’s shut against me,” I told him. “Ruthie’s married\\nthe fellow I detested. They’re none of them talking to me now.”\\n\\nThe old fellow turned on me snorting like a stallion. “That don’t\\nmatter, lad. You’re your own world. Do without ’em. Everything comes\\nright in the end.”\\n\\n_Dream Haven!_ How cool the name sounds! What memories of sunshiny\\nmornings it brings back. Day after day I watched and waited for the\\nletter from America. There were times when I made sure that I could feel\\nit approaching. “It will be here to-morrow,” I said.\\n\\nI tortured myself by picturing how different life would have been had\\nI taken Randall at his word. It was the kind of torture that became a\\nluxury. I should have brought her to Dream Haven, perhaps. I played\\nwith my fancy, pretending that we were here together; so actual were my\\nimaginings that I was incredulous when, on coming to myself, I found her\\nabsent. The dreams were more real than the reality.\\n\\nWakened in the morning by the twittering of birds, I would raise myself\\non my elbow and marvel at the sweet flushed face beside me on the\\npillow and the glorious, yellow streaming hair. Slowly it would fade and\\nvanish. There were walks which we took through the lonely woodlands when\\nall the delayed intimacies of love filled life with unashamed passion.\\nThere were wild days on the downs, when rain and wind, driving our\\nbodies together, stung me to a new protecting ecstasy. There were quiet\\nevenings in the gloaming--Sunday evenings were the best--when Vi sat at\\nthe piano playing and singing, while Dorrie knelt beside her, fingering\\nher dress. All these ghost-scenes stand clear in my memory as though\\nthey had happened.\\n\\nI must have cultivated this unreal life to the point of danger in my\\neffort to escape the ache of the present. Had I lived by myself I might\\nhave crossed the border-line, but the comedy of Uncle Obad was always\\ndrawing me back. He kept watch over me like a kind old spaniel.\\n\\nIn the morning from where I sat in the garden, I could see him farther\\ndown the <DW72> through the orchard, trotting in and out his pens with\\nhis disreputable dust-coat flapping. Just as once, when he had no money,\\nthe appearance of affluence had been his hobby, so now, when he could\\nafford to dress respectably, he delighted in looking shabby. He left\\nhis clothes unfastened in the most unexpected places; Aunt Lavinia was\\ncontinually making grabs at him and buttoning him up. In the afternoon\\nshe sent us off for long walks together to prevent his getting fat. On\\nthese occasions he would explain his loose philosophy, which consisted\\nof a large-minded, stalwart carelessness.\\n\\n“Keep your end up; it’s in each one of us to be happy. Don’t do too much\\nremembering; live your day as it comes. Your Grandmother calls me the\\nSpuffler--so I am. Where’d I be now, I ask you, if I hadn’t spuffled?”\\n\\nSo the summer fled by, and the woods grew browner, and the air had a\\nsharper tang. The letter from Sheba had not come. I could mark time no\\nlonger; at last I left for Woadley.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III--NARCOTICS\\n\\nI was twenty-six when I entered into possession of Woadley. By my\\ngrandfather’s will I inherited an annual income of seven thousand\\npounds. I was at an age when, for most men, everything of importance\\nlies in the future and that which lies behind is of no consequence--in\\nthe nature of an experiment.\\n\\nI did not regard my past in that light. It was vital. Until the woman\\nI loved should share my fortunes I felt the future to be an indefinite\\npostponement. How she could come into my life again I dared not surmise;\\nthat she would come, I never doubted. I knew now that the letter which\\nI had both hoped for and dreaded, would never arrive. For Dorrie’s sake\\nthey had decided to remain together. In my wiser moments I was glad\\nof it; I knew that, had she chosen otherwise, our love would have been\\ndegraded.\\n\\nStrong influences were brought to bear to press me into public life. My\\nsituation and training entitled me to take up a position of some\\nlocal importance. I might have stood for Parliament, but I shrank\\nfrom publicity. All I asked was to be left alone to follow up my own\\ninterests in quiet. I had come so suddenly into a sphere of power\\nwhich I had done nothing to merit, that ambitions which had still\\nother ambitions for their goal, ceased to allure me. My temperament was\\nnatively bookish; by nature I was a Fellow of Lazarus and by compulsion\\na conscientious country squire. When I was not at Oxford, dreaming in\\nlibraries, I was at Woadley, superintending the practical management of\\nmy estate.\\n\\nThe joy of sex and its fulfilment in a home, which apply the spur to\\nmost men’s activities, to me were denied; it was unthinkable that I\\nshould marry any woman other than Vi. The energies which should have\\nfound a domestic expression with me became the mental stimulus of an\\nabsorbing scholarly pursuit.\\n\\nThrough my Oxford lectures and fugitive contributions to periodicals,\\nI began to be known as an authority on the intellectual revolt of\\nthe Renaissance; by slow degrees I set about writing the life of\\nthat strange contradiction, half-libertine, half-saint, Æneas Sylvius\\nPiccolomini.\\n\\nEngaged in these employments, I grew to love the smooth gray days of\\nWoadley which stole by ghost-like and unnumbered. And I came to love the\\nWoadley country with a passion which was as much due to its associations\\nas to its beauty. When I had grown tired of researches into things\\nancient, one of my greatest joys was to plod to Ransby through rutted\\nlanes deep in hedges, and so out to the north beach where the sea\\nstrummed against the land, and the wind raged, and the blackened hull of\\nthe wreck crouched beneath the weight of sky.\\n\\nGrandmother Cardover’s shop saw me often. There in the keeping-room,\\nwith its dull red walls and leisurely loud ticking clock, we would talk\\ntogether of bygone times and of those which were, maybe, coming. At\\nfirst she urged me to marry, and to take up the position in the county\\nwhich should be mine. But soon, with the easy fatalism of old age, she\\naccepted me for what I was, and ceased to worry.\\n\\nWith my father I held no communication--the breach had become final; so\\nof Ruthita I heard next to nothing. But as regards Lord Halloway, quite\\ninadvertently I increased my knowledge.\\n\\nOne squally night I was returning from Ransby, driving up the sodden\\nroad to the Hall, when my attention was attracted by a camp-fire.\\nI halted out of curiosity, and struck across the turf to the light.\\nBetween me and the fire was a wind-break of young firs, a diminutive\\nplantation behind which, as behind bars, figures prowled. As the flames\\nshot up, the figures yearned toward the clouds; as the flames died down,\\nthe figures seemed to creep into the ground. On reaching the wind-break\\na lurcher growled, and I heard a man’s voice telling the beast to\\nlie quiet. I was about to declare myself, when a hand was laid on my\\nshoulder. I leapt aside, peering into the darkness.\\n\\n“All right, brother,” a voice said huskily. “I’m meaning you no hurt.”\\n\\nA woman’s face pushed itself out of the blackness; by the light of the\\nfire I saw that it was Lilith’s.\\n\\n“Now you’re here, brother, we’ve come back to Woadley.”\\n\\nShe spoke as though our meeting had been pre-arranged.\\n\\nGazing through the trees I saw the old yellow caravan: and G’liath; the\\ngaudy woman was there, and the hag who had tried to tell Vi’s fortune on\\nthe marshes.\\n\\nThe huddled gipsy tents became an accustomed sight and the center of\\na new interest in my landscape. The proud lawlessness of the gipsies\\nappealed to my own suppressed wildness. They opened a door of escape\\nfrom commonplace environment. Their unannounced comings and goings had\\nan atmosphere of mystery and stealth which filled me with excitement. Of\\na night I would look out from my bedroom windows and see the red glow of\\ntheir camp across the park-land; in the morning nothing would remain but\\nblackened turf and silence.\\n\\nI went on many tramping expeditions with Lilith. She had become\\ncuriously elflike and wilful since those early days. She seemed to live\\nwholly in the moods and sensations of the present; of the past she would\\nspeak only in snatches. Sometimes, when she softened, she would mention\\nRuthita; but it was long before I discovered her secret and the reason\\nwhy for so many years the gipsies had refused to camp at Woadley.\\n\\nAll one day in the height of summer we had wandered, across meadows\\nand by unfrequented by-roads, too content to pay heed to where we were\\ngoing; when evening overtook us we were miles from home. It was too late\\nto turn back, unless we walked on to the nearest village and hired a\\ntrap and drove. Lilith scouted the proposal with scornful eyes as too\\nutterly conventional. We would make a camp for the night and return\\nto-morrow.\\n\\nThere, alone in the open, with great clouds thumbing the western sky,\\nand birds sinking into tree-tops singing, “Home, home, home,” life\\nliberated itself and rose in the throat as though it had never been\\nbound and civilized. We spoke only in monosyllables; even words were a\\nform of captivity. Collecting brushwood, we built our fire and ate our\\nmeal between the walls of bushes. Slowly the silver trumpet of the moon\\nrose above leafy spires.\\n\\nWe made a strange pair, Lilith and I--she the untamed savage, gloriously\\nresponsive, and I, for all my attitudes of mind, outwardly the sluggish\\nproduct of reserve and education. Through the gray smoke I watched her,\\nwith her red shawl falling from her splendid shoulders, her glittering\\near-rings and her large soft eyes. I told myself stories about her quite\\nin the old childish vein. I recalled how the Bantam and I had always\\nbeen hoping to find her. What fun it would be to vanish for a time,\\nleaving responsibilities behind, and to take to the road together! White\\nmists, rising from the meadows, erected a tent about us which towered to\\nthe sky. Here in the open was privacy from the impertinent knocking of\\ndestiny.\\n\\nBut she was not thinking of me. Her eyes gazed far away. Her arm was\\nhollowed and her head bowed, as though a little one pressed against her.\\nWith her right hand she fumbled at her breast, loosening her bodice. Her\\nbody swayed slowly to and fro in a soothing, rocking motion. I had seen\\nher like this before when she thought no one was looking.\\n\\nLeaning forward I plucked a twig from the fire to light my pipe. She\\nthrew herself back from me startled and sprang to her feet. “Don’t touch\\nme.” Her voice was hoarse and choking.\\n\\nLooking up from where I sat, I saw that her bosom panted and that her\\nnostrils were quivering with animal fright. But it was her eyes that\\ntold me; they were wide and fixed like those of one who has been roused\\nfrom sleep, and is not yet fully awake.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to touch you, Lil. I’m your pal, girl, Dante Cardover.”\\n\\nWhen I spoke she came to herself and recognized me. Her fear vanished\\nand her arms fell limp to her side. “I’m goin’.”\\n\\n“But what’s the trouble? I thought we were to camp here to-night.”\\n\\n“Dun know.” She swept back the hair from her forehead and drew her\\nshawl tighter. “I dun this before, just the two of us--and it didn’t end\\nhappy.”\\n\\n“But not with me.”\\n\\n“Afore ever I knew you, silly. When I was little more’n a child--long\\ntime ago.”\\n\\nWe stamped out the fire before we left, and stole silently across the\\nmoonlit meadows. She walked ahead at first in defiance; presently,\\nashamed of the distrust she had shown, she fell back and we traveled\\nside by side.\\n\\n“Lil, I watched you; you were dreaming that you had your little baby\\nback.”\\n\\nShe placed her hand in mine, but she gave me no answer.\\n\\n“Who was he--the man who did this to you long ago, when you camped alone\\ntogether?”\\n\\nShe turned her face away; her voice shook with passion. “I don’t have to\\ntell you; you know ’im.”\\n\\nThe people were few with whom we were both acquainted. I ran over the\\nnames in my mind; the truth flashed out on me.\\n\\n“Was it because of that you wouldn’t camp at Woadley?”\\n\\nShe bent her head, but the cloud of hatred in her face would have told\\nme.\\n\\nAfter learning this new fact about Halloway, he was never long absent\\nfrom my mind; for Lilith, though we never referred to him and she had\\nat no time mentioned him by name, was a continual reminder. I became\\nfamiliar with his doings through the papers. He was making a mark for\\nhimself in politics; there was even a talk that he might find a seat\\nin the cabinet. I read of Lady Halloway’s seconding of her husband’s\\nambitions. From time to time her portrait was printed among those of\\nsociety hostesses. But this Ruthita was unreal to me; she had nothing\\nto do with the shy girl-friend whom I had known. Of the true Ruthita I\\nlearnt nothing.\\n\\nI often wondered what was the condition of affairs between herself and\\nHalloway. Was she happy? Was he kind? Was it possible that she should\\nhave outlived her first judgment of him? Perhaps all this outward\\ndisplay of success had its hidden emptiness. Behind Halloway lay a host\\nof ruined lives, Lilith’s among them, the waste of which he could not\\njustify.\\n\\nI had been five years at Woadley, when my work made it necessary that I\\nshould spend some weeks in London in order to be near libraries. It was\\njust after Christmas that I came to town. With my usual clinging to\\nold associations, I took rooms at Chelsea, almost within sight of the\\nmansion which had witnessed my uncle’s brief reign of splendor. From my\\nwindows I could see the turgid river sweeping down to Westminster,\\nand the nurse-girls with perambulators and scarlet dots of soldiers\\nloitering beneath bare trees of the Embankment.\\n\\nOn rising one morning, I found that the subdued grays and browns had\\nvanished--that London was glistening with snow. My spirits rose to an\\nunaccustomed pitch of buoyancy; I tossed aside my writing and went\\nout into the streets. Coming to the Spuffler’s old house I halted; the\\nmemory of the Christmas I had spent there leapt into my mind with every\\ndetail sharpened. Things which I had not thought of for years came back\\nluminously--scraps of conversation, gestures, childish excitements. This\\nwintry morning was reminiscent of a snow-lit, sun-dazzled morning of\\nlong ago. I recalled how Ruthita had bounced into my room to let me see\\nher presents; how she had balanced herself on the edge of my bed in her\\nlong white night-gown, with her legs curled under her and her small\\nfeet showing; how she had laughed at my care of her when I wrapped the\\ncounterpane about her shoulders to prevent her from catching cold. Every\\nmemory was somehow connected with Ruthita. And here I stood, a man\\nof thirty, looking up at the windows from which we had once gazed out\\ntogether--and I had not seen her to speak to for five years.\\n\\nI could not get her out of mind. I did not want to. I kept tracing\\nresemblances to her in the girls whom I passed in the streets. Some of\\nthem were carrying their skates, with flying hair and flushed faces.\\nOthers, whom I met after lunch in the theatre districts, were going to\\nmatinées with school-boy brothers. I wanted to be back again in the old\\nintimacy, walking beside her. Since that was impossible, I set myself\\ndeliberately to remember.\\n\\nIn the afternoon I strolled into the Green Park. Constitution Hill was\\nscattered with spectators all agape to see the quality drive by. Every\\nnow and then a soldier or statesman would be recognized; the word\\nwould pass from mouth to mouth with a flutter of excitement. The trees\\nenameled in white, the grass in its sparkling blanket, the sky banked\\nwith soft clouds, the flushed faces--everything added its hint of\\nanimated and companionable kindness.\\n\\nOf a sudden in the throng of flashing carriages, my attention was\\ncaught by an intense white face approaching, half-hidden in a mass\\nof night-black hair--the face was smaller than ever, and even more\\npathetically patient. By her side sat the man whom I now almost hated,\\nlooking handsome and important; the years had dealt well with him, and\\nhad heightened his air of dignity and aristocratic assurance. He was\\nspeaking to her lazily while she paid him listless attention, never\\nmeeting his glance. It was plain to see that, whatever he had or had\\nnot been to other women, his passion for her was unabated. She looked\\na snow-drop set beside an exotic orchid; the demure simplicity of her\\nbeauty was accentuated by the contrast. Her wandering gaze fell in my\\ndirection; for an instant my gaze absorbed her. She started forward from\\nthe cushions; her features became nipped with eagerness. Those wonderful\\neyes of hers, which had always had power to move me, seemed to speak of\\nyears of longing. A smile parted her lips; her listlessness was gone.\\nShe leant out of the carriage, as though she would call to me.\\n\\nLord Halloway’s hand had gone to his hat, as he turned with a gracious\\nexpression, searching the crowd to discover the cause of his wife’s\\nexcitement. His eyes met mine. His face hardened. Seizing Ruthita’s arm,\\nhe dragged her down beside him. The carriage swept by and was lost in\\nthe stream of passing traffic. All was over in less time than it has\\ntaken to narrate.\\n\\nThat night at Chelsea I could not sleep for thinking. Across the ceiling\\nI watched the lights of the police-boats flash in passing. I listened to\\nthe river grumbling between its granite walls. Late taxis purred by; I\\ntook to counting them. Big Ben lifted up his solemn voice, speaking to\\nthe stars of change and time. I thought, imagined, remembered. What had\\nhappened to us all that we were so gravely altered? What had happened\\nto her? What had he done to quench her? Then came the old, forgotten\\nquestion: had I had anything to do with it?\\n\\nNext day I set myself to conquer my restlessness, but my accustomed\\ninterests had lost their fascination. Neither that day, nor in those\\nthat followed, could I recover my grip on my habitual methods of life.\\nWhat were the temptations, disappointments of a dead past\\ncompared with those that were now in the acting? My scholarship, my\\nlove of books, my undertakings at Woadley had only been in the nature of\\nnarcotics; I had drugged myself into partial forgetfulness. Now the\\nold affections, like old wounds, ached and irked me. One glimpse of\\nRuthita’s white intensity had stabbed me into keenest remembrance.\\n\\nI _had_ to see her again; the hunger to hear her speak was on me--to\\nlisten to the sound of her voice.\\n\\nSeveral times I saw her driving in the Park, sometimes alone, sometimes\\nwith Halloway. She never looked at me, but I was certain she was aware\\nof me by the way her cheek grew pale. Only a few years ago I had been\\nhalf her life, free to hold her, to come and go with her, to disregard\\nher; now she passed me unnoticed. I haunted all places where I might\\nexpect to find her; whether I met or missed her my pain was the same. At\\nthe back of my mind was the constant dread that her husband would hurry\\nher away to where I could not follow.\\n\\nIt was a blustering afternoon in early March, on a day of laughing and\\ncrying--one of those raw spring days, before spring really commences,\\ncapricious as a young girl nearing womanhood, without reason gay and\\nwithout reason serious. In the sunshine one could believe that it was\\nalmost summer, but winter lurked in the shadows. A flush of young green\\nspread through the tree-tops; in open spaces crocuses shivered near\\ntogether. The streets were boisterous with gusty puffs of wind which\\nsent dust and papers circling. In stiff ranks, like soldiers, the houses\\nstood, erect, straining their heads into the sky, as if trying to appear\\ntaller. Clouds hurried and fumed along overhead travel-routes, and rent\\ngashes in their sides as if with knives, letting through the sudden\\nturquoise. Presently slow drops began to patter. Umbrellas shot up.\\nBus-drivers unstrapped their capes. In the Circus flower-girls picked up\\ntheir baskets and ran for shelter.\\n\\nOn arriving in the Mall I found people standing along the open pavement\\nin a lean, straggling line, despite the threatened deluge, I learnt\\nthat royalty were expected. Soon I heard a faint and far-off cheering. A\\npoliceman raised his arm; traffic drew up beside the curb. Just as I had\\ncaught the flash of Life Guards and the clatter of their accoutrements,\\na closed brougham reined in across my line of vision. With an\\nexclamation of annoyance I was moving farther down the pavement, when a\\nsmall gloved hand stretched out from the carriage-window and touched\\nme. I turned sharply, and found myself gazing into Ruthita’s eyes. She\\nsigned to me to open the door. Before the coachman could notice who had\\nentered, I was beside her. Clutching my arm, she leant out and ordered,\\n“Drive to Pope Lane.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV--RUTHITA\\n\\nWe lay back against the cushions. We acted like conspirators--it was\\ndifficult to tell why. The surprise of meeting her thus suddenly had\\ndeprived me of words. It must have been the same with her; we clasped\\nhands in silence.\\n\\n“I had to see you--had to speak to you.”\\n\\nShe was panting--almost crying.\\n\\n“Of course. Why not? It was foolish to go on the way we were going.”\\n\\n“Yes, foolish and heartbreaking. It wasn’t as though we were wanting to\\ndo anything wicked--only to meet one another, as we used to.”\\n\\nHer voice trailed off into a little shivering sob; she flickered her\\neye-lids to prevent the tears from gathering.\\n\\n“Ruthie, you mustn’t carry on so.” Then, “What has he done to you?” I\\nasked fiercely. “You’re afraid.”\\n\\n“He’s guessed.”\\n\\n“Guessed what?”\\n\\n“What you never knew.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“I can’t tell you. If you’d guessed, it might have made all the\\ndifference.”\\n\\nI did not dare to speak--her whisper was so ashamed. Her hand was hot in\\nmine. She withdrew it. When I leant over her she shuddered, just as the\\ntrees had done when they knew the rain was coming, as though I were\\na thing to her both sweet and dreadful. She took my face between her\\nhands, and yet shrank back from me. She delighted in and feared the\\nthing she was doing.\\n\\nThe rain volleyed against the carriage, shutting us in as with a tightly\\ndrawn curtain; yet, did I look up, through the gray mist the tepid gold\\nof the sun was shining.\\n\\n“Ruthie, it seems almost too good to be true that we’re alone at last\\ntogether--to have you all to myself.”\\n\\n“Did you ever want me, Dannie?”\\n\\n“_Did I ever want you!_”\\n\\n“But as much as you wanted her?”\\n\\n“Differently, yes.”\\n\\n“You poor boy. And you didn’t get either of us.”\\n\\n“Couldn’t be helped, Ruthie. That’s life--to be always wanting and never\\ngetting. But I have you now and, perhaps, one day----”\\n\\n“But how can you? She’s married.”\\n\\n“One can’t tell. Things come unexpectedly. I didn’t expect half-an-hour\\nago that I’d be with you.”\\n\\nShe fell to asking me little stabbing questions. When I only answered\\nher vaguely, “Don’t let’s start with secrets,” she implored me.\\n\\n“But it’s five years--there’s so much to explain.”\\n\\n“Yes--on both sides.”\\n\\n“You seemed--seemed to dislike him,” I said. “I never understood----”\\n\\nShe took me up quickly. “Nor did I. Don’t let’s talk about it--not yet,\\nDante.”\\n\\nSo I told her about my doings, the book I was writing and the little\\ndaily round at Woadley; and then I told her of why I had quarreled with\\nmy father.\\n\\n“But he let me marry Halloway, and you’ve never----”\\n\\n I laughed. “Ah, but\\nno matter what Halloway did as a bachelor, he was discreet when it came\\nto marriage.”\\n\\nShe drew me forward to the light; doubt was in her eyes. “But\\nyou--you’re unhappy too.”\\n\\n“I’ve gained everything I played for; I played to lose.”\\n\\n“Everything?”\\n\\n“I didn’t deserve Vi. And I didn’t deserve you; if I had, I shouldn’t\\nhave lost you.”\\n\\nNot until I had replied did she realize how much she had told me.\\nShe was not happy! I wanted to ask her questions, so many\\nquestions--questions which I had no right to ask, nor she to answer.\\n\\n“And you--you have no children?”\\n\\nShe hesitated. “No.”\\n\\nI rubbed the damp from the panes. We were in Stoke Newington. The storm\\nwas over; streets and roof-tops shone as with liquid fire. Children\\ngoing home from school, were laughing and playing. They might have been\\nmyself and Ruthie of years ago.\\n\\n“They won’t see me,” I warned her.\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Folks at Pope Lane.”\\n\\n“They’re not there. Only Hetty’s left to take care of the house. They’ve\\ngone away for a few days.”\\n\\n“Then I can see it all again. We can walk in the garden together and\\npretend that things are exactly as they were.”\\n\\n“Oh, Dannie!” she cried. “I _can_ call you Dannie, can’t I?”\\n\\nTime slipped away. She was my little sister now--no longer Lady\\nHalloway. At the posts before the passage we alighted--that was the\\nfirst news the coachman had of whom he had been driving. We went slowly\\nup the lane, where the shadows of the limes groped like tentacles\\nfingering the sunshine. When I felt beneath the creepers and the bell\\njangled faintly, Ruthita clutched my arm, attempting to appear bold.\\n\\nHetty stared at us. “Well, I’ll be blowed!”\\n\\nWe pushed by her smiling, assuring her that we had no objection. Not\\nuntil we had rounded the house, did I hear the rattle of the door\\nclosing.\\n\\nNothing ever changed in that walled-in garden. Flowers grew in the same\\nplaces--crocuses, daffodils, and hyacinths. Peaches on the wall would\\nsoon ripen. Presently sunflowers, like sentinels in gold helmets, would\\nstand in stately line. Pigeons strutted on the slates of houses opposite\\nor wheeled against the sky. There was the window of Ruthita’s bedroom,\\nup to which I had so often called.\\n\\nThe hole, which had been bricked up between the Favarts’ garden, was\\nstill discernible. Everything retained its record; only we had changed.\\n\\nTruants again, stealing an hour together, I listened expectant to hear\\nHetty call, “Dant-ee. Dant-ee. Bedtime.” The old excitement clutched my\\nheart. Her starched skirt would rustle down the path, and we would\\nrun into the gooseberry bushes to hide. I glanced at the study-window.\\nSurely I should see my father seated there, leaning across the desk with\\nhis head propped by his arm. Surely that hand of Ruthita’s in my own was\\ngrowing smaller. I should turn to find a child in a short print-frock,\\nwith clusters of ringlets on her shoulders. A shutter in my mind had\\nopened; the past had become present. Ah, but I was no longer anxious to\\nescape. The walled-in garden was all I wanted. I was tired of liberty.\\nI was ready to be commanded. I was willing that others should order my\\nlife.\\n\\nThat the illusion might not slip from me, I half shut my eyes. Drip,\\ndrip, drip, from eaves and branches! The earth was stirring in the\\ngentle quiet. Through drenched bushes and on the vivid stretch of lawn\\nblackbirds were hopping, delving with their yellow bills. Perhaps I was\\ndwindling into a small boy, just as I had once hoped in the forest that\\nI might suddenly shoot up into manhood. How absurd to believe that I was\\nthirty, and had seen so much of disillusionment! That was all a dream\\nout of which I was waking--I had been here all the time in the narrow\\nconfines of the walled-in garden. The old enchantment of familiar\\nsensations stole upon me--I was Dannie Cardover of the Red House;\\nplaying tricks with his imagination.\\n\\nHow did it happen? Was it I or was it Ruthie? Her lips were pressing\\nmine. A step came down the path behind us. We sprang apart, laughing\\nsoftly with reckless joy at our impropriety. Which of us would have\\nthought ten years ago that there would be anything improper in being\\ncaught kissing?\\n\\nHetty pretended not to have seen us, but her flustered face told its\\nstory.\\n\\n“D’you remember, Hetty, how I once found you doing that to John?”\\n\\nShe writhed her hands under her apron, trying to appear shocked and\\nnot to smile. “I remember, Sir Dante; ’t’aint likely I’d forget.” Then,\\ndisregarding me for Ruthita, “I was about to h’arsk your ladyship,\\nwhether I should get tea ready.”\\n\\nRuthita took her by the hand. “You didn’t talk to me that way once,\\nHetty. I’m just Ruthie to you always, and Sir Dante is plain Dannie.”\\n\\nShe looked up and met the laughing reproach in our eyes. Her apron went\\nto her face and her bodice commenced to quiver. “Little did I think when\\nI washed and dressed yer little bodies that I should ever see this\\nday,” she sobbed. “It’s breakin’ me ’eart, that’s what it is, all this\\nquarrelin’. Why shouldn’t I speak to ’im if I wants ter? Why shouldn’t\\n’e kiss ’is own sister if he likes? Wot’s it matter if all the\\nneighbors was lookin’? There’s too little lovin’ and too little kissin’;\\nthat’s wot I say. ’Tain’t right ter be ashamed o’ bein’ nateral. If it\\n’adn’t ’a’ been for bein’ afraid and ashamed, I might ’a’ married\\nJohn. The nus-girl next door got ’im. There’s allaws been someone\\na-lookin’ when I was courtin’--there’s been too little kissin’ in my\\nlife, and it’s yer Pa’s fault, if I do say it, wi’ ’is everlastin’\\nlook of ‘Don’t yer do it.’”\\n\\n“If it’s as bad as all that, Hetty, I’m sure you won’t mind if I----”\\n She made an emotional armful, but between struggling and giggling she\\nallowed me.\\n\\nWe had tea together in the formal dining-room, with its heavy furniture\\nand snug red walls. We made Hetty sit beside us; she protested and was\\nscandalized, but we wouldn’t let her wait. As we talked, the old freedom\\nof happiness came back to Ruthita’s laughter. The mask of enforced\\nprejudices lifted from Hetty’s face. All our conversation was of the\\npast--our adventures, childish mutinies, and punishments. We told Hetty\\nwhat a tyrant she had been to us. We asked her whether her nightgowns\\nwere still of gray flannel. I accused her of being the start of all my\\nnaughtiness in the explanation she had given me of how marriages were\\nconcocted. It was like putting a wilted flower into water to see the\\nway she picked up and freshened. When she had nothing else to reply, she\\nwagged her head at us, exclaiming, “Oh, my h’eye--what goin’s on! It’s a\\ngood thing walls ain’t got ears. What would your poor Pa say?”\\n\\nWe left her and wandered through the rooms together. We only opened\\nthe study-door; we did not enter. It had always, even when we had been\\ninvited, seemed to have been closed against us. Books lay on the desk,\\ndust-covered. It was allowed to be tidied only in my father’s presence.\\nWe both felt that he must know of our trespassing, even though we could\\nnot see him. I had the uncanny feeling that he was still there at the\\ntable writing; any moment he might glance up, having completed his\\nsentence, and I should hear his voice. Not until we had climbed the\\nstairs did we rid ourselves of the shadow of his disapproval. In the old\\ndays when we were romping, we had been accustomed to hear his dreaded\\ndoor open and his stern voice calling, “Children! Children! What d’you\\nthink you’re doing? Not so much noise.” It was something of this kind we\\nwere now expecting and with the same sensations of trembling.\\n\\nThe house was memory-haunted. Following our footsteps, yet so discreetly\\nthat we never caught them, were a witch-faced girl and a sturdy boy.\\nWhere pools of sunlight lay upon the floor we lost them; when we turned\\ninto dark passages, again they followed. On entering rooms, we half\\nexpected to find them occupied with their playing; when the budding\\ncreeper stirred against the walls, it was as though they whispered. They\\nwere always somewhere where we were not--either in the room we had just\\nleft, or the room to which we were going.\\n\\nWe entered what had been my bedroom. The sun was westering, playing\\nhide-and-seek behind crooked chimneypots. Below us the garden lay in\\nshadow, cool and cloistered.\\n\\nKneeling beside the window, with our elbows on the sill, not watching\\none another’s eyes, we whispered by fits and starts, leaving our\\nsentences unended. Most of what we said commenced with “Do you\\nremember?” and drifted off into silence as the picture formed. It was\\nlike flinging pebbles into a pond and watching the circles spreading.\\nOne after another memories came and departed--all that we had done\\ntogether and been to one another in that conspiracy of childhood. There\\nwas the pink muffler she had made me, the guinea-pig about which I had\\nlied to her, the tragic departures and wild homecomings of schooldays,\\nand the week when the Bantam had declared his love for her. And there\\nwere memories which preceded her knowledge--my quest for the magic\\ncarpet. How I wished I might yet find it; I would fly by night to\\nher window and carry her off, re-visiting old happinesses while Lord\\nHalloway lay snoring.\\n\\nI don’t know how we came to it--I suppose we must have been speaking\\nabout Vi. Presently Ruthita said, “You could only love golden hair,\\ncould you, Dannie?”\\n\\nI didn’t know what she was driving at; her voice shook and her face was\\nflushing.\\n\\n“Dark-haired girls never had any chance with you, did they? You told me\\nthat long ago, after Fiesole. I remembered because--because----”\\n\\n“I was a boy then, and was clumsy.”\\n\\n“But you spoke the truth, though you did say that for sisters black\\nhair was the prettiest in the world. It hurt because at that time I\\nfancied--you can guess what.”\\n\\n“You never showed it.”\\n\\n“You never looked for it--never asked for it.”\\n\\nI knew to what she referred. It was on the night of my sudden return\\nfrom the Red House because the Spuffler had lost our money. I was\\nsitting at this window as I was now sitting. A tap at the door had\\nstartled me; then a timid voice had said, “It’s only Ruthita.” She had\\ncrept in noiselessly as a shadow. Her dear arms went about my neck,\\ndrawing down my face. “Oh, Dannie, I’m so sorry,” she had whispered;\\n“I’ve never missed welcoming you home ever since you went to school.”\\n She had nestled against me in the dark, her face looking frailer\\nand purer than ever. She had slipped on a long blue dressing-gown, I\\nremember, and her black hair hung about her shoulders like a cloud.\\nJust below the edge of the gown her pale feet twinkled. I noticed that\\na physical change had come over her. Then I had realized for the first\\ntime that she was different as I was different--we were no longer\\nchildren. I had fallen to wondering whether the same wistful imaginings,\\nexquisite and alluring, had come to her. With an overwhelming reverence,\\nI had become aware of the strange fascination of her appealing beauty.\\nIn the confessing that followed I had told her of my jilting by Fiesole,\\nand had spoken those stupid words about loving only golden hair. How\\nwounding I had been in my boyish egotism! And that was not the last time\\nI had wounded her in my blindness.\\n\\nScene after scene came back to me--into each I read a new meaning in the\\nlight of what she had told me: the Snow Lady’s hints before I sailed for\\nAmerica; Ruthita’s appeal for my protection against Halloway, and her\\nsudden acceptance of him directly she heard that I was with Vi at Sheba.\\n\\n“Ruthie, all this was very long ago; so many things have happened since\\nthen, there can be no harm in talking about it. You wanted me right up\\nto the last--and I was too selfish to know it.”\\n\\n“Right up to the last,” she whispered, and I knew she meant right up to\\nnow.\\n\\n“And this--and this is what your husband has guessed?”\\n\\nShe took my hands in both her own, speaking with quiet dignity. “I had\\nto tell you. Perhaps I too have been selfish, but I couldn’t let you\\nmisunderstand me any longer. I’ve seen you watching for me, and I’ve had\\nto go by you without looking. We never had any secrets, you and I;\\nyou must have wondered why I let my husband make me cut you--I’ve been\\nwicked--I couldn’t trust myself. When I heard that you’d gone to Sheba,\\nI didn’t care what happened. I’d always hoped and hoped that you might\\ncome to love me. But it seemed I wasn’t wanted, so I just took---- He’s\\nbeen good to me, but it isn’t like living with the person you love best,\\nis it? You mustn’t hate him any more; to love a woman who can’t love\\nyou back again makes even success empty--and he’s been used to take love\\nwithout asking.”\\n\\nWe sat very still. We saw Hetty come out into the garden and walk down\\nthe path as though she were looking for us. We waited to hear her call,\\nbut she re-entered the house, leaving the silence unruffled.\\n\\n“I’ve made a pretty fair mess of things, haven’t I? There was Vi first,\\nand now there’s you. I’m a pretty fair blighter.”\\n\\nShe pressed herself against me to stop me. “Oh, you mustn’t say that. It\\nhurts. You mustn’t say it.”\\n\\n“But I am. Even your husband knows it.”\\n\\n“Some day you’ll marry and everything’ll come right.”\\n\\n“For Vi, if we have the luck to come together. But what about you? What\\nabout even Halloway?”\\n\\nShe avoided answering my self-accusations by attracting attention to\\nherself. “From the first he didn’t want me to know you; he gave\\nexcuses, and I understood. Because I couldn’t give him love, I gave\\nhim everything else that he wanted. But now--now that I’m going to be\\na mother, I had to tell you. I want it to be a boy, Dannie. Waiting for\\nhim, I’ve thought so much of old days. I felt that if you didn’t know,\\nsomehow, things wouldn’t go right--because when he comes I want him to\\nbe like you.”\\n\\nShe had risen, letting go my hand.\\n\\n“I had always thought of you as my sister,” I faltered.\\n\\n “I know--and\\nyou were a dear brother. It was just my foolishness to want you to be\\nsomething else.”\\n\\nFor a moment she clung to me, hiding her face against my shoulder. Then\\nwe passed down the stairs, afraid to be alone any longer.\\n\\n“Goin’?” Hetty inquired. “You won’t tell the master, will yer?” She\\nglanced toward the study-door as though he were behind it and might have\\noverheard.\\n\\nAt the end of the lane the carriage was standing. In the presence of\\nthe coachman Ruthita’s tones were conventional. “You’re going westwards?\\nWhere can I drop you?”\\n\\nIn the carriage I asked her whether her husband would know of what we\\nhad done.\\n\\n“I shall tell him.”\\n\\n“Don’t you think he might be willing to let us be friends?”\\n\\n“I’ll ask him,” she said, “but----”\\n\\nAt Hyde Park Corner the carriage pulled up and I alighted. I watched her\\neager face looking back at me, growing smaller and smaller.\\n\\nWandering aimlessly through the parks, I sat for a time by the\\nSerpentine. The nerves of all that had happened in the past five years\\nwere cut. If I had married Ruthita, would she have been happy? The\\nthought of marrying her was just as impossible to me now as it had been\\nwhen Grandmother Cardover had mentioned it at Ransby. And yet, at a\\ntime when I had been most sensitive of injustice, I had been unjust to\\nher---- And now she was going to be a mother--little Ruthita, who seemed\\nto me herself so much a child!\\n\\nWhen I came into Whitehall, the pale twilight of spring still hovered\\nabove house-tops; from streets the flare of London steamed up. The\\nopal of the sky reflected the marigold-yellow of illumined windows;\\narc-lights, like ox-eye daisies, stared above the grass of the dusk.\\n\\nI made my way to my club and sank into a chair, aimlessly skimming the\\npapers, reading scarcely a line. Few people were about; the room was\\nempty save for one other loiterer. Spring in the streets was calling.\\n\\nThe man strolled up to me, holding an illustrated weekly in his hand. I\\nknew him slightly and nodded.\\n\\n“Writing a book on the Renaissance, ar’n’t you? Here’s something a bit\\nin your line. Funny how Paris’ll go mad over a thing like that!”\\n He smacked the page. “Girl comes from nowhere. Her lover writes a\\nplay--that’s the story. There’s a mystery. The play’s difficult to\\nunderstand, so it must be brainy. Now I like a thing that don’t need no\\nexplanation: Marie Lloyd, the Empire, musical comedy--that’s my cut.”\\n\\nHe tossed me the weekly and turned on his heel to walk out. Annoyed at\\nbeing disturbed, I glanced down irritably.\\n\\nFrom a full-page illustration the face of Fiesole smiled up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V--LA FIESOLE\\n\\nIt was ridiculous this curiosity, but I knew how to explain it--it\\ngrew out of my life’s great emptiness since I had listened to Ruthita’s\\nconfession. She had made me realize as never before how I had muddled my\\nchances of happiness. I had heard nothing from Vi in all these years and\\nnow I had learnt that, without knowing it, I might have had Ruthita.\\nMy interests had lost their charm; I wanted an excuse to leave my work.\\nThis matter of Fiesole had cropped up, so here I was on my way to Paris,\\nmore for the sake of something to do than anything else.\\n\\nI had not the remotest intention of renewing her acquaintance. Unseen\\nby her, I would watch her from some corner of the theatre, and then slip\\nback to London. There would be piquancy in the thought that I had gone\\nto see her for old time’s sake, and that she would never know about it.\\nAs for speaking to her, that would be an insult after what had happened\\nat Venice. Probably she hated me. She ought to, if she did not.\\n\\nThough I smiled at myself, truth to tell, I was rather pleased to find I\\ncould still be so impulsive; romance in me was not dead after all these\\nyears of uneventful waiting. This journey was the folly of a sentimental\\nboy--not the cynical act of a man of the world.\\n\\n_La Fiesole! La Fiesole!_ Since she had stared out at me from the\\nprinted page I was continually coming across her. Everyone was\\ndiscussing her; she had sprung out of nowhere into notoriety. Greater\\nthan Bernhardt, men said of her: a spontaneous emotional actress of the\\nfirst rank--the sensation of the moment.\\n\\nFrance took her seriously; England quoted French eulogies in italics.\\nFantastic legends were woven about her name, made plausible by an\\noccasional touch of accuracy.\\n\\nAntoine Georges had written the play--it was based on the _amours_ of\\nLucrezia Borgia. It was said that he was La Fiesole’s lover, that she\\nhad given him the plot--that she had even helped him write it; some\\nwent so far as to say that it was founded on an incident in her own\\npast life, transposed into a fifteenth century setting. Antoine Georges\\ndenied that he was her lover; but the world smiled skeptically--it liked\\nto believe he was. One story asserted that she had been a _fille de\\njoie_ when he came across her; another, with that French instinct for\\nthe theatric, that he had reclaimed her from a low café in Cherbourg\\nin which she danced. Nothing was too incredible in the face of her\\nincredible success. One fact alone was undisputed--that she was the\\ndaughter of the famous Italian actor, many years dead, Signore Cortona.\\n\\nThis confirmed what I already knew about her. I remembered how she had\\ntold me in Oxford of her early stage career, which she had abandoned\\nto go traveling. I recalled how she had said, “I’m an amateur at\\nliving--always chopping and changing. I’ll find what I want some\\nday.”---- So she had found it!\\n\\nIn the English press she was made a peg on which to hang a whole\\nwardrobe of side-issue and prejudice. The decency of the French stage\\nwas discussed. The question was introduced as to whether such a play\\nwould be allowed to be performed in London. The superiority of English\\nmorals was the topic of some articles; of others, the brutal prudery\\nby which British art was stifled. A fine opportunity was afforded\\nand welcomed for slinging mud at the censor. The discussion was\\ngiven academic sanction when Andrew Lang patted it on the head in an\\ningeniously discursive monologue on the anachronisms of playwrights,\\nin which he made clear that Monsieur Georges’s tragedy was riddled with\\nhistoric falsity.\\n\\nIt was nearing five when we steamed into the Gare du Nord. My first\\njourney to Paris had been prompted by Fiesole. Then I was escaping from\\nher; now I was going to her. For old time’s sake I made my headquarters\\nat the hotel at which I had then stayed in the Rue St. Honoré. After\\n_diner_ I set out through thronged streets to book a seat at the\\ntheatre. Upon making my request at the office, the man shrugged his\\nshoulders and turned away with the inimitable insolence of French\\nmanners. It was as though he had said, “You must be mad, or extremely\\nbourgeois.” I had affronted him personally, the theatre-management, La\\nFiesole and last, but not least, the infallible intelligence of Paris.\\nDid Monsieur not know that La Fiesole was the rage, the fashion? Every\\nseat was taken--taken weeks ahead.\\n\\nMy second request was apologetic and explanatory: I honored La Fiesole\\nso much that I had journeyed from London on purpose to see her. What was\\nthe earliest date at which he could make it possible? He directed me to\\nan agency which had bought up all the best seats in the house; here I\\nsecured a box at an extortionate price for five nights later.\\n\\nIn the intervening days I was frequently tempted to abandon my project\\nand return. It seemed the height of foolishness to squander five days\\nin order that I might court disappointment. She must have altered--might\\nhave deteriorated. It was just possible there was a grain of truth\\nin the wild stories that circulated about her. And yet---- There were\\nmemories that came to me full of nobility and gentleness: windswept days\\nat Oxford; a night at Ferrara; days and nights on the lapping lagoons of\\nVenice. I wanted to see her again--and I did not. I blew hot and cold.\\nAnd while I hesitated, spring raced through the streets of Paris with\\ntossing arms and reckless laughter.\\n\\nWhen I entered the theatre it was already packed. The audience seemed\\nconscious that it had assembled for a great occasion; it had dressed for\\nits share in the undertaking. Gowns of marvelous cut and audacity\\nwere in evidence. The atmosphere was heavy with the perfume of exotic\\nfemininity and flowers.\\n\\nMy box was on the right-hand side, just above and next to the stage.\\nBelow me was a nodding sea of plumed head-dresses, naked shoulders, and\\ngleaming bosoms; rising tier on tier to the gold-domed roof, was a\\nwall of eyes and fluttering white faces. Everything was provocative of\\nexpectancy. Gods and goddesses, carved on the columns and painted on the\\ncurtain, alone were immobile.\\n\\nA quick succession of taps sounded, followed by three long raps. The\\ntheatre was plunged in shadow. As though a crowd drew away into the\\ndistance, the last murmur spent itself. The curtain quivered, then rose\\nreluctantly on the illusion which had brought the unrelated lives of so\\nvast an audience together.\\n\\nWe saw an Italian garden, basking in sunlight and languorous with\\nsummer. Beneath the black shade of cypress-trees stretched marble\\nterraces, mounting up a hillside, up and up, till they hung gleaming\\nlike white birds halfhidden in the velvet foliage. In the foreground\\na fountain splashed. A little way distant the Pope Alexander lolled,\\ntoying with his mistress, Giulia. Up and down pathways lined with\\nstatues, groups of courtiers wandered: youths in parti- hose and\\nslashed doublets; girls, vividly attired, exquisitely young, engaged in\\nthe game of love. Guitars tinkled and masses of bloom flared stridently\\nin the sun. Sitting by the fountain was the Madonna Lucrezia and the\\nyoung Lord of Pesaro. Her face was turned from us; we could only see\\nher vase-like figure and the way she shook her head in answer to all he\\noffered.\\n\\nThe envoy from Naples enters and with him the Duke of Biseglia; he\\nurges the Pope for a last time to make an alliance with his country by\\nbetrothing the Madonna Lucrezia to the Duke. But the Pope does not want\\nthe alliance; he is joining with Ludovico of Milan against Naples\\nand war will result. While the Pope is refusing, for the first time\\nLucrezia looks up and her face is turned towards us--the face I had\\nknown in my boyhood, innocently girlish, fresh as a flower, so ardent\\nand beautiful with longing that the theatre caught its breath at sight\\nof it and a muffled “Ah!” swept through the audience.\\n\\nAs though attracted by a power which is outside herself, she rises,\\nhesitating between shyness and daring, and steals to where the young\\nDuke is sullenly standing. She takes his hand and presses it against\\nher breast. He snatches it from her. She commences to speak, at first\\nhaltingly, but with gathering passion. Her voice is hoarse and sultry,\\nlike that of a Jewess; it is a voice shaken with emotion, which now\\ncaresses and now tears at the heart. The drone of merriment in the\\ngarden and the tinkling of the guitars is hushed. Listless lovers come\\nout from the shadows and gather about her, amused by her earnestness.\\nShe pleads with the Pope, her father, to give her the Duke--not to send\\nhim away from her. Biseglia interrupts haughtily, asserting that he only\\ndesired her for State reasons and that since the Pope refuses Naples’\\nfriendship, he would not marry the Madonna Lucrezia though her father\\nwere to allow it.\\n\\nAlexander laughs boisterously at this quarrel of children and like\\na huge Silenus wanders off into the garden, leaning on his mistress,\\nGiulia, followed by his train of minstrels and dilettantes. Their\\nsinging grows more faint as they mount the terraces towards the palace.\\n\\nLucrezia watches them depart with a face frozen with despair. As\\nBiseglia turns to go, she darts after him and drags him back, fawning on\\nhim, abasing herself, offering herself to him, telling him that whatever\\ncomes of it she cannot live without him. He regards her in silence; then\\nfalls to smiling and flings her from him, reminding her that she is\\nthe Pope’s bastard. At that the boy Lord of Pesaro, who has watched\\neverything from the fountain, runs with drawn sword to her defense.\\nBut she springs between them, saying that when the time comes to kill\\nBiseglia, she will take revenge in her own way like a Borgia. The\\ngreat Pope, looking back, has seen her awakened savagery and laughs\\nuproariously. The scene ends with the garden empty and Lucrezia\\nstretched out on the ground, kissing the spot which Biseglia’s feet have\\ntouched and weeping in a frenzy of abandon, while the Lord of Pesaro\\nlooks on impotent and broken-hearted.\\n\\nBetween the first act and the second the French have invaded Italy, so\\nthe Pope and the King of Naples have found a common enemy and a common\\nneed for alliance. The Duke of Biseglia has again been sent to Rome\\nto sue for the hand of Lucrezia. But in the meanwhile she has been\\nbetrothed to the Lord of Pesaro, and, to prevent him from joining\\nwith the French when Lucrezia is taken from him, his removal has been\\nplanned.\\n\\nThe curtain goes up on a night of bacchanalian riot in the Papal\\ngardens. Beneath trees a costly table has been spread, at which sit\\nmen and women attired in every kind of extravagance, as animals, pagan\\ndeities, and mythological monstrosities. In the branches overhead are\\nset sconces and blazing torches. Distantly over white terraces and\\npathways the moon is rising. In the foreground are mummers and tumblers.\\nThe servitors who pass up and down the company are humpbacks, dwarfs,\\nEthiopians, and dancing-girls.\\n\\nIn the center of the table sits the Pope, and next to him Lucrezia, and\\nnext to her Biseglia. Opposite to Biseglia is seated the Lord of Pesaro,\\nand next to him a woman in a mask. With the heat of the wine and the\\nlateness of the hour the women lie back in their lovers’ arms--all\\nexcept the masked woman and the Madonna Lucrezia. Lucrezia sits\\nerect like a frightened child, the one pure thing in the freedom that\\nsurrounds her. Biseglia pays her no attention, and from across the table\\nthe Lord of Pesaro watches.\\n\\nThe Pope twits Biseglia on his coldness, saying, “Think you that my\\ndaughter hath a deformity?” And Biseglia gives the irritable answer,\\n“Can a man love a woman while that young spit-fire glowers green envy at\\nhim opposite?”\\n\\nPesaro leaps to his feet, but the Pope, as though to pacify him, pledges\\nhim and hands the goblet to the masked woman to offer to him. Still\\nstanding uncertain, Pesaro receives it from her. Raising it slowly, his\\nlips touch the brim; he clutches at his throat, upsetting the cup so\\nthat the red stain flows towards Lucrezia. He leans out, gazes in her\\neyes, and crashes across the table, twisting as he falls, still looking\\nup at her.\\n\\nThe silence that follows is broken by a low rippling laugh. The company\\ngaze in astonishment; it is Lucrezia who is laughing. The child in her\\nface is dead; her expression is inscrutable, wicked and sirenish. She\\nsways towards Biseglia, bending back her head and twining her arms about\\nhim. “Hath the Pope’s daughter a deformity that thou canst not love her?\\nBehold, thou shalt judge. She will dance and dance, till she dances thee\\ninto rapture and thy soul is poured out upon her.”\\n\\nFrom the hand of a servitor she snatches a torch and steps into the\\nopen. She commences to dance and, as she dances, unbuckles her girdle\\nso that her gown slips from her. As the beat of the music grows more\\nfurious she unbinds her hair, so that it writhes like snakes about her\\nfirm white arms and bust. Dwarfs clamber into trees and slide out along\\ntheir branches, raining rose-leaves on her as she passes. The strangely\\nattired company forget their jaded decadence and sprawl across the\\ntable, digging their elbows into its scattered magnificence, following\\nthe gleam of her young, white body as it twists and turns beneath the\\nwhirling torch.\\n\\nBut her gaze is bent always on Biseglia; her eyes are aslant and\\nbeckoning. Her bosom rises and falls more fiercely with the wrenching\\nin-take of the breath. Will he never go to her?\\n\\nShe flings back her hair from her shoulders; her body flashes like an\\nunsheathed sword. Nearer and nearer to him she dances. His eyes rest\\non her moodily, half-closed. Does he make a movement, quickly she\\nwithdraws.\\n\\nShe has flung away her torch and is spinning madly with her hands\\nclasped behind her head. The grass is hidden with rose-leaves; she\\nfloats--her feet scarcely stir them. Suddenly she stops; stands erect\\nfor an ecstatic moment; sways dizzily; her strength is gone. Her hands,\\nsmall and pitiful, fly up to cover her eyes. She shakes her hair free to\\nhide her. Her body crumples. She is broken with her shame and futility.\\nBiseglia leaps the table and has her in his arms as she falls, pressing\\nhis hot lips against hers. With clenched fists she smites him from her,\\nslips from his embrace, and runs shimmering like a white doe through the\\nforest of blackness.\\n\\nWith a shout the revelers shatter the banquet and pour in pursuit of\\nher. Biseglia leads them, darting ahead into the shadows. Dancing and\\nsinging, the disheveled bacchanalians stagger across the dark, trouping\\nalong dusky terraces with twining arms, following the fleeing dryad.\\n\\nTorches are burnt out and smolder in their sockets. Night is tattered\\nby the dawn. Amid the havoc of trampled chalices and glass sprawls the\\nwine-stained figure of the dead Lord of Pesaro--the man who, could she\\nhave loved him, would have given her all.\\n\\n_La Fiesole! La Fiesole!_ We rose as one man as the curtain dropped.\\nWe did not care to think whether this was wrong--it was lovely. She\\nhad danced our souls out of their prejudices, out of their walls of\\nrestraint into chaos. The rapture of her beauty ran through our veins\\nlike wine. Our imaginations pursued her along pale terraces. The\\nfragrance of crushed rose-leaves was in our nostrils and the coolness of\\nnight. Our breath came short, as though we had been running. Our senses\\nwere reeling and our eyes dazzled. We stood up in our places clutching\\nat the air, calling and calling, hungry for the sight of her.\\n\\nFor myself, I was smitten with blindness. My eyes saw the striving\\nthrong through a mist and probed into the beyond, where she ran on and\\non palely, forever from me. I shouted to her, but she grew more distant;\\nnever once did she look back or stay her footsteps.\\n\\nI was aware of a deep stillness--a hoarse peal of laughter: thousands of\\neyes glared up at me and down on me, and mouths gaped mockery. The mist\\ncleared; Fiesole was standing before the curtain. The audience had grown\\nhushed at sight of her while I had continued calling. From the stage,\\ntwenty feet away, she was smiling at me, insolent and charming, her body\\nstill shuddering with exertion beneath the velvet cloak which lay across\\nher shoulders. What did I care, though to-morrow the whole of Paris\\nshould laugh? She had danced my soul into ecstasy. I placed my hands\\non the edge of the box and leant out drunkenly, shouting her name,\\n“_Fiesole! Fiesole!_”\\n\\nShe kissed her hand at me derisively, bowed to the audience, and was\\ngone.\\n\\nI sank in my place, a sickening nostalgia for her upon me. I did not\\nreason; I only knew I wanted her--wanted her as she had once wanted me,\\nwith her hands and eyes and body. In a dim way I felt angry with myself\\nfor having lost her. She had made me disgusted with my coldness at\\nVenice as I had watched my counterpart, the Duke of Biseglia. From the\\ntheatric torture in her face I had learnt something of how brutal a man\\nmay be when he fancies that he is righteously moral. She, whom I saw now\\nso remotely, might have been mine; through these chilly years La Fiesole\\nmight have been my companion, had I had the faith to take what was\\noffered. I had sought the things that were impossible. I had made a god\\nof my scruples. I had sinned weakly, following Vi who did not belong to\\nme. I had sat down to wait for her, and all the while Life was tapping\\nat the door. I tasted Life to-night---- And who knows? Perhaps I had\\nbroken this woman’s heart. I would no longer be niggardly. I would go to\\nher; accuse myself to her; beat down her hatred of me; carry her off.\\n\\nWhile these thoughts trooped across my mind, the crooked sphinx-like\\nsmile of Paris wandered over me, examined me, hinted at tragedy with\\nlaughter, and widened its painted lips at my absurdity.\\n\\nThe curtain rustled. The warning raps sounded. Lights sank, and heads\\nbent forward.\\n\\nIn a dim-lit room, chilly to the point of austerity, sat Lucrezia.\\nTall candles shone upon her face--a face purged of emotion, nunlike and\\nwooden with an expression of distant contemplation. Behind her head was\\nan open window through which floated in the sound of music. She heeded\\nit not at all. In the far corner stood a bed with the curtains drawn\\nback. At an altar a lamp burnt before a shining crucifix. Her women were\\nunrobing her for the bridal night. They spoke to her, but she did not\\nanswer. They blamed her for her indifference to Biseglia: she had never\\nkissed him, never caressed him since the night when she had won him. Did\\nshe not know that he hungered for her kindness?\\n\\nShe gave them no answer. They lifted her this way and that as though she\\nwere a doll; she seemed to have forgotten her body. She might have been\\nin a trance, leading a life separate, dreaming of things innocent and\\nholy.\\n\\nOne by one the candles were extinguished; only the lamp burnt before the\\naltar. When her women were gone; she slipped from the bed and knelt with\\nher head bowed before the cross.\\n\\nThe music dies; silence falls. Along the passage comes a creeping\\nfootstep. The door opens; Biseglia enters, blinking his eyes at the\\nroom’s dimness. He whispers her name. At last she hears him and rises,\\nstanding before the altar. He crosses the room reverently. He halts,\\ngazing at her. He rushes forward, masters her, crushes her to him, and\\ncries that she torments him--starves him.\\n\\nWhen she makes no response, but lies pulseless in his arms, he carries\\nher to the bed, incoherently claiming as his right the fondness she does\\nnot give him. Then he grows gentle and kneels before her, kissing her\\nfeet and calling her his god.\\n\\nShe speaks. Her voice is small. “Biseglia, thou didst love me only when\\nI had made myself worthless that I might win thy fondness.”\\n\\nHe yearns up to her with his arms, disowning his former coldness,\\nprotesting that he adores her. She leans over him sadly; he raises his\\nlips to hers. As she kisses him, her expression kindles to triumph. She\\nwithdraws her hand from her breast; the Borgian dagger sinks into his\\nheart.\\n\\nShe gazes stonily on the man who had once refused her. The lamp before\\nthe altar flickers and goes out. The room is plunged in darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI--SIR GALAHAD IN MONTMARTRE\\n\\nLong after the curtain had fallen I sat on. I had seen Antoine Georges\\nstep before the footlights leading Fiesole. I had seen him alternately\\nbend above her hand and bow his acknowledgments to the applause. I did\\nnot like him, this fat little Frenchman, with his thin beard and spindly\\nlegs. The polite proprietorship of his bearing towards her had impressed\\nme as offensive. I felt sure that he was smacking his lips and saying,\\n“They shall believe that it’s all true, this that they say about us.”\\n\\nFrom the wings had come lackeys carrying garlands. They had built up a\\ngarden about her. The people had gone mad, standing up in their places\\nand thunderously shouting. From all parts of the theatre flowers\\nhad rained on her. They had stormed her with flowers. Women had torn\\nbouquets from their dresses and wreaths from their hair. It might have\\nbeen a carnival; the air was dense with falling blossoms. And she had\\nfaced them with the smile of a pleased child, while Monsieur Georges\\nbent double before her.\\n\\nIt was all over. Men were busy with brooms, sweeping up the litter of\\nher triumph. This happened every night: they got used to it. Already in\\nthe _fauteuils d’orchestre_ perfunctory faded women were adjusting linen\\ncoverings. The last stragglers of the audience were reluctantly going\\nthrough the doors.\\n\\nA man entered my box and tapped me on the shoulder. I stared up at him;\\nhis expression made me laugh. He evidently mistook me for a crank who\\nwas likely to give trouble. I reached for my hat and coat wearily; I\\nfelt that I had been beaten all over. As I folded my scarf about my neck\\nI made bold to ask him where I could find Fiesole. He shrugged his\\nshoulders, darting out his hands, palms upwards, as one who said, “Ah,\\nit is beyond me! Who can tell?”\\n\\nBut it was important that I should see her, I urged; I was an old\\nfriend.\\n\\nAn old friend! These days La Fiesole had many old friends. Were it\\npermitted to her old friends to see her, all the messieurs would cross\\nthe footlights. He eyed me with impatience, anxious to see the last of\\nme, his waxlike face wickedly ironic.\\n\\nI produced a fifty-franc note. Would it not be possible for him to\\ndeliver her a message?\\n\\nIf Monsieur would write out his message he would make certain that La\\nFiesole got it.\\n\\nSo I scribbled my address on the back of a card, asking her to allow me\\nto speak with her.\\n\\nI folded the fifty-franc note about it and handed it to my tyrant.\\nFrom the lack of surprise with which he accepted I gathered that he had\\npocketed greater amounts for a like service.\\n\\nIn the street I paused irresolute. From my feet, could I follow it, a\\npath led through crowded boulevards directly to her. I could not be very\\ndistant from her; a lucky choice of direction, the chance turning of a\\ncorner might bring us face to face. That I was in her mind was probable.\\nShe was remembering, as I was remembering, that day at Lido and that\\nnight at Venice. Was she satisfied with her revenge? She had always been\\ngenerous. Somewhere in this passionate white night of Paris her car\\nsped on through illumined gulleys; she lay back on cushions, her eyes\\nhalf-shut, her mouth faintly smiling, picturing the past at my\\nexpense. I liked to think that she hated me; it was in keeping with her\\ncharacter; I respected her for it. The women who had loved me had made\\nthings too easy; it had always been I who had done the refusing. My\\nblood was eager for the danger of pursuing. I longed for resistance that\\nI might overcome her. I loved her with my body, I told myself, as I\\nhad never loved a woman; my cold, calculating intellectuality was in\\nabeyance. That she should make my path of return difficult added a novel\\nzest.\\n\\nThe human tide was drifting towards Montmartre; I fell in and followed.\\nOn the pavement before cafés at little round tables _boulevardiers_ were\\nseated, sipping their absinthe, their eyes questing for the first hint\\nof adventure. Taxis flashed by, soaring up “the mountain” like comets,\\ngiving me glimpses as they passed of faces drawn near together,\\nravishing in their transient tenderness. How was it? What had happened?\\nFor the first time in my remembrance I had ceased to analyze; I had\\nceased to sadden my present with foreknowledge.\\n\\nFar away the Place Pigalle beckoned. Up tortuous streets, between\\nancient houses, the traffic streamed like a fire-fly army on the march.\\nAs I neared the top I entered the pale-gold haze of its unreality.\\nElectric signs of L’Abbaye, the Bal Tabarin, and the Rat Mort glittered\\non the night like paste jewels on the robe of a courtesan. Women trooped\\nby me like blown petals, peering into my face and smiling invitation.\\nI marked down their types in my mind by the names of flowers--jasmine,\\nrose, poppy.\\n\\nI was curiously transformed from that evening of long ago when I had\\nwatched these sights with horror, and had fled from Paris in the dawn to\\nFlorence. I felt no anger, no revulsion--only tolerance. I had finished\\nwith peeping beneath the surface. Fiesole had taught me to despise all\\nthat. _Fiesole! Fiesole!_ I saw her always dancing on before me, mocking\\nmy sobriety. Yes, I told myself, she had made me kinder.\\n\\nA couplet from _Sir Galahad in Montmartre_ dinned in my brain and summed\\nup my estimate of my former self\\n\\n                   “He sees not the need in their faces;\\n\\n                   ’Tis the sin and the lust that he traces.”\\n\\nI had never looked for the need in any woman’s face. I had been absorbed\\nin contemplation of my own chastity--had hurried through life with\\nhands in pockets, fearful lest I might be robbed. Vi’s need, which I had\\nrecognized, I had made ten times more poignant. I had waited for her.\\nWhat good had I done by it? I might go on waiting. Meanwhile there were\\nFiesole and Life knocking at my door. My constancy to Vi had become a\\nluxury.\\n\\nA girl slipped her arm in mine. “’Allo! You zink I am pretty?”\\n\\nShe was a _cocotte_, little more than a child, so delicate and slight.\\nHer hair was flaxen and blowy; her complexion a transparent china-white;\\nher dress décolleté and cut in a deep V between the breasts. She pushed\\nher small face up to mine with the red lips parted, clinging to me with\\nthe innocent familiarity of one who had asked no more than a roguish\\nquestion.\\n\\n“You’re pretty, but----”\\n\\n“Zen we go togezer!”\\n\\n“I’m afraid not.”\\n\\n“Pourquoi non?”\\n\\n“I’m hoping to meet someone.”\\n\\nShe released me at once with a good-natured smile. “La! La! I hopes you\\nfind ’er.”\\n\\nShe tripped away, turning before she was lost in the crowd to wave her\\nhand. I told myself that her flower was the jonquil.\\n\\nIt was one o’clock when, after wandering about, I found myself back\\nat the same place. I could not sleep; my brain was too active with\\nexcitement. Instead of being sad because of Fiesole, I was unreasonably\\nelated. I took a seat at a table on the pavement and ordered coffee\\nand cognac. Every man and woman within sight was a lover, and I sat\\nsolitary. As the hour grew later men and women grew more frank in their\\nembraces, and all with that naïve assumption of privacy which makes the\\nFrenchman, even in his vices, seem so much a child. The sex-instinct\\nbeat about “the mountain”--the air quivered and pulsated.\\n\\nGirls rustled in the shadows. Lovers, chance-met, danced home together.\\nStrange to say, I found nothing sinful in it--only romance. I had ceased\\nto look beyond the immediate sensation.\\n\\n“Poor boy! You not find ’er?”\\n\\nI looked up; my lady of the jonquils was leaning over my shoulder.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Eh bien, peut-être, you find her to-morrow, _hein!_ If not, zere are\\nozers.” She waved her small gloved hands in a circle, bringing them back\\nto include herself. She looked a good little soul, standing there so\\nbravely disguising her weariness.\\n\\n“Tired?”\\n\\n“It ees nozing.”\\n\\n“Won’t you join me?”\\n\\nImmediately we were in sympathy. She owned me with a playfulness which\\nhad no hint of indelicacy. Drawing off her gloves, she rested her chin\\non her knitted fingers and regarded me laughingly with her world-wise\\neyes. She was scarcely more than half my years, I suppose.\\n\\n“Zere are ozers,” she repeated.\\n\\n“Not for me,” I said; “not to-night.”\\n\\n“Dieu! You are funny, my friend. You lofe like zat?” The waiter hovered\\nnearer, flirting his napkin across the marble-tables.\\n\\nI beckoned; he dashed up like a hen to which I had scattered grain.\\n\\n“Croûte au pot?”\\n\\n“Bien, Monsieur.”\\n\\n“Filet aux truffes.”\\n\\n“Bien, Monsieur.”\\n\\n“Salade romaine.”\\n\\n“Bien, Monsieur.”\\n\\n“Vouvray.”\\n\\n“Bien, Monsieur.”\\n\\nI turned to her. She had corn-flower eyes like Kitty--I had been\\nwondering of whom I was reminded. I passed her my cigarette-case. She\\nchose one fastidiously and tilted it between her lips with the smile of\\na _gamine_.\\n\\nWhile we ate neither of us said much--she was hungry; but, as we sipped\\nour coffee and the pile of cigarette ends grew, I found myself telling\\nher--asking her if a man had refused her once, whether she could ever\\nagain love him.\\n\\n“If he haf a great heart, oui. If he haf not----” She threw her\\ncigarette away. “C’est la vie! Quoi?” She snapped her fingers and leant\\nover and took my hand, this gay little Montmartroise. “But you haf; zo\\ncourage, my friend.”\\n\\nI did not want to be left alone; she knew it. A _fiacre_, with a\\nbattered race-horse propped between the shafts, had drawn up against\\nthe curb. On the box a red-faced _cocher_ nodded. We climbed in and she\\nnestled beside me. The _cocher_ looked across his shoulder, asking where\\nto drive. “Straight on,” I told him.\\n\\nWe crawled away down “the mountain”; as we went, she sang contentedly\\njust above her breath. When we reached the Madeleine the _cocher_\\nhalted, inquiring gruffly whither he should drive. “Tout droit. Tout\\ndroit”; we both cried impatiently. So again we moved slowly forward.\\nThere was no doubt in the man’s mind that we were mad.\\n\\nShe drew closer to me and cuddled into my coat; the foolish prettiness\\nof her dress was no protection against the chill night air. We lay back,\\nher head resting on my shoulder, gazing up at the star-scattered\\nsky. The asphalt surface of the boulevard, polished by petrol and\\nrubber-tires to the dull brightness of steel, glimmered in a long line\\nbefore us reflecting the arc-lamps like a smooth waterway--like a slow\\ncanal in ancient Venice.\\n\\nWhere we went I do not know; I did not care to notice. The creaking\\n_fiacre_ had become a gondola and it was Fiesole who leant against\\nme. Sometimes the _cocher_ drew up to light a cigarette and to glance\\nsuspiciously down upon us. Then I was brought back to reality. We\\ncircled the Bastille and prowled through the _Quartier Latin_, where the\\nnight was not so late. We crossed the river once more and crept along\\nthe _Quai des Tuileries_; then again we climbed “the mountain” and\\nplunged into the grimy purlieus of _Les Halles_. Market-carts were\\nalready creaking, in from the country with swinging lamps. Wagons piled\\nhigh with vegetables, loomed mountainous under eaves of houses. From\\nthe market came grumbling voices of men unloading, and the occasional\\nsquealing of a stallion.\\n\\nThe _cocher_ wriggled on his box and confronted me fretfully. Before\\nhe could ask his question, “Sacré nom d’un chien!” I shouted fiercely,\\n“Allez. Allez.” Meekly he jerked at the reins, sinking his head between\\nhis obedient shoulders.\\n\\nI looked down at the tiny face beside me--the face of a white flower\\nwhose petals are folding. She had ceased her singing an hour ago.\\nFeeling me stir, she struggled to open her eyes and slipped her small\\nhand into mine. When I drew my arm tighter about her she sighed happily.\\n\\nAbove the tottering roofs of Paris the night grew haggard. One by one\\nstars were snuffed out. Wisps of clouds drove across the moon like\\nwitches riding homeward. It was the hour when even Paris grows quiet.\\nRagpickers were slinking through the shadows, raking over barrels set\\nout on the curb. Women, shuddering in bedraggled finery--queens of\\nMontmartre once, perhaps, whose only weariness had been too many\\nlovers--dragged themselves to some sheltered doorway, thankful for a bed\\nin the gutter, if it were undisturbed. In boulevards for lengthy pauses\\nours was the only sound of traffic.\\n\\nMy head jerked nearer hers. Her breath was on my cheek; I could feel the\\ntwitching of her supple body. Poor little lady of the jonquils--of what\\nwas she dreaming? What had she expected from me? She would tell often of\\nthis eccentric night and no one would credit her story.\\n\\nWhen I awoke she was still sleeping. A spring breeze ruffled the trees;\\nsparrows were chirping; a golden morning sparkled across the waters of\\nthe Seine. The sun, still ruddy from his rising, stood magnificently\\nyoung among the chimney-pots, trailing his gleaming mantle beneath the\\nbridges.\\n\\nThe battered race-horse had stumbled with us just beyond the Louvre\\nand stood with his head sagging between his knees, his body lurching\\nforward. The reins had fallen from the _cocher’s_ hands; his thick neck\\nwas deep in his collar; and his face looked strangled. From across\\nthe road a waiter scattered sand between his newly set out tables and\\nwatched us with amused curiosity.\\n\\nMy body was cramped. As I attempted to uncrook my legs, my companion\\nopened her eyes and stared at me in amazed confusion. She yawned and sat\\nup laughing, patting her mouth. “Oh, _la, la_----. Bonjour, toi!”\\n\\nWe examined ourselves--I in my crumpled evening-dress, and she in her\\nflimsy gown and decorative high-heeled shoes. I had a glimpse of my\\nface in imagination--pale and donnish; the very last face for such a\\nsituation. How ill-assorted! Then I laughed too; the _cocher_ lumbered\\nround on his box and burst into a hoarse guffaw at sight of us. We all\\nlaughed together, and the waiter ceased sanding his floor to laugh with\\nus.\\n\\nWe left the racer to his well-earned rest and all three went across\\nto the café. As we soaked bread in our bowls of coffee and plied our\\nspoons, we chatted merrily like good comrades. Then we parted with the\\n_cocher_, leaving him agreeably surprised, and sauntered down the Quai\\nwhere workmen in blue blouses, hurrying from across the bridges, found\\ntime to nudge one another knowingly and to smile into our eyes with a\\nglad intimacy which was not at all offensive.\\n\\nIn a narrow street where “the mountain” commenced, she halted and placed\\nboth her hands on my shoulders, tiptoeing against me.\\n\\n“One ’as to go ’ome sometime, mon ami.” She was determined to be a\\nsportsman to the end. “But remember, mon petit, if you do not find\\n’er, zere are ozers.”\\n\\nI put my hand into my pocket. She examined what I gave her. “Mais, non!”\\n she exclaimed, flushing.\\n\\n“But yes--for remembrance.”\\n\\nShe tilted up her face and her happy eyes clouded; the tired cheeks\\nturned whiter and the painted lips quivered. “Little one, keess me.”\\n\\nSo I parted from this chance-met waif with her brave and generous\\nheart---- And this was what my madness and Fiesole had taught me. For\\nthe time the memory of Vi was entirely banished from my thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII--SATURNALIA\\n\\nAt my hotel I found no message. But it was still early; she might\\nnot have received my card and, as yet, did not know my address.\\nThe intoxication of the previous night still flicked my spirit into\\noptimism--perhaps she would answer me in person.\\n\\nThen came the reaction--the truer judgment. If she had desired to see\\nme, she could have sent round word to my box at the theatre. After all,\\nwhy should she desire to see me? She was famous and had made her world\\nwithout me. When we parted, I had left her with a memory so humiliating\\nthat it must scorch her even now. These were things which a woman\\nfinds it difficult to forgive--impossible to forget. Still, there\\nwas curiosity--a woman’s curiosity! She might resist it for a time,\\ntantalizing both me and herself; but she would have to see me presently,\\nif only to wound me.\\n\\nI scarcely stirred from my hotel, afraid lest I should miss her. By the\\ntime evening fell, I had come to a new conclusion--that the ironical\\nscoundrel, who had so coolly pocketed my money, had destroyed my card.\\nTo make sure of reaching her, I wrote a letter to the theatre, saying\\nmany true things foolishly. Then, in sheer restlessness, I hurried to\\nthe boulevard in which her theatre was situated, hoping to get a glimpse\\nof her either coming or going.\\n\\nI could not bring myself to enter--it was too horrible and\\nbeautiful--she was dancing away her womanhood in there. Shockingly\\nfascinated as I had been by the spectacle, I felt a lover’s jealousy\\nthat strangers should watch it.\\n\\nI hated the gay crowds seething in to find enjoyment in my shame and her\\ntragedy. They were jesters at something sacred.\\n\\nI paced the boulevard with clenched hands and snapping nerves; I could\\nnot go far away from her, and I could not go to her. Within my brain she\\nwas always dancing, dancing, and the jaded eyes of Paris grew young with\\ngreed of her sensational perfection. I longed to go to her, to protect\\nher, to save her from herself. She needed me, though she would scorn the\\nidea if I told her. If she would but allow it, I would carry her away\\nfrom these hectic nights and this subtle, soul-destroying sensualism.\\nHer shame was my doing; I would give all my life to make amends to her.\\n\\nBut she gave me no sign that she had either seen or heard from me. What\\nelse could I expect? How could I explain my infatuation even to myself,\\nlet alone to her, as more than physical attraction? And was it more?...\\nOnce she had offered me far more than I now begged; I had churlishly\\nrefused it. How could I account to her for my altered valuation of her\\nworth? She would not answer--I knew that now. I should have to compel\\nher attention.\\n\\nNext morning in reading the papers I came across her name frequently.\\nShe was the madcap darling of Paris; every edition contained some\\nanecdote of _La Fiesole_ and her erratic doings. One item captured my\\ninterest especially: there was a certain café in the Champs Elysées to\\nwhich she went often after theatre hours. For the time being she had\\nmade it the most fashionable midnight resort in Paris.\\n\\nThat night, having bribed heavily for the privilege, I was seated at a\\ntable near the entrance. If she came, she could scarcely pass without\\nseeing me. The place was an _al fresco_ restaurant, gorgeously\\ntheatric. It stood in a garden, brilliantly romantic and insincere as\\na stage-setting. Overlooking the garden were white verandahs,\\ncreeper-covered and garish with hothouse flowers; throughout it were\\nscattered kiosks and bowers in which the more secret of the diners\\nsat. The plumed trees were knit together with ropes of lights, like\\npearl-necklaces which had been tossed into their branches casually. In\\nbushes and hidden among blossoms, glow-worm illuminations twinkled, like\\nfaeries kindling and extinguishing their lamps. Everything was subdued\\nand sensuous. Fountains played and splashed. Statues glimmered. A gipsy\\norchestra, fierce-looking and red-coated, clashed frenzied music, which\\nsobbed away into dreamy waltzes and elusive snatches of melody. The\\neffect was bizarre--artistically unreal and emotionally tropic.\\n\\nHere one might experience a great passion which consumed by its panting\\nbrevity; everyone seemed present for the express purpose of realizing\\nsuch a passion.\\n\\nAt tables seated in couples were extraordinary people, dressed to\\nplay their part in a dare-devil romance. Here were men who looked like\\nRussian Archdukes, bearded, bloodless, and insolently languid. Sitting\\nopposite them were voluptuous women, tragically exotic, dangerously\\ncoaxing, with the melodramatic appearance of scheming nihilists.\\nThey were reckless, these costly, slant-eyed odalisques--exiles from\\ncommonplace kindliness, born gamblers for the happiness they had thrown\\naway and would never re-capture. There was the atmosphere of intrigue,\\nof indiscreet liaison about almost every couple. They acted as though\\nfor one ecstatic moment the world was theirs. Their behavior was\\neverything that is exaggerated, fond, undomestic, and arrogantly\\nwell-bred.\\n\\nThere was something lacking. As each new arrival entered, the slanted\\neyes of the women and the heavy eyes of the men were raised droopingly\\nwith an expression of furtive expectancy. They were a chorus assembled,\\nwaiting for the leading actor till the play should commence.\\n\\nLow rippling laughter, spontaneously joyous, sounded. From the trellised\\nentrance she emerged and halted, looking mock-bashful, taking in the\\neffect she had created, spurning the gravel with her golden slipper. Her\\ngown was of dull green satin, cut audaciously low in the back and neck,\\nand slashed from the hem to expose her slim ankle and golden stocking.\\nShe wore no jewels, but between her breasts was a yellow rose, which\\ndrifted nodding on the whiteness of her bosom as she drew her breath.\\nHer reddish gold hair was wrapped _en bandeaux_ about her small pale\\nears and broad pale forehead. It shone metallic; its brightness dulled\\nand quickened as she swayed her splendid body.\\n\\nAt her first appearance a muttering had arisen, gathering in volume. As\\nshe lifted her head and her green eyes flashed through her long, bronze\\nlashes, we grew silent. It was as though a tamer had entered a cage of\\npanthers and stood cowing them with her consciousness of power. Yes, she\\nknew what they thought of her, and guessed what they admired in her. She\\nsurveyed us with quiet contempt. I felt that behind whatever she did\\nor said there lay hidden a timid girlishness. She was still the old\\nFiesole, the happy companion who could tramp through rainstorms like a\\nman. Her brave pagan purity these half-way decadents had not tarnished;\\nby them it was unsuspected. I watched her tall, lithe figure; the neck\\nso small that one could span it with a hand; the firm, high bosom,\\nproud and virginal; the straight, frank brows, and the mouth so red and\\nsweetly drooping. Other women looked decorative and tinsel beside her\\nnatural perfection.\\n\\nMy throat was parched. My eyes felt scalded. I was unnerved and\\na-tremble. Her beauty daunted as much as it challenged. What bond still\\nexisted between us that would draw her to me? She looked so remote, so\\nhemmed in by the new personality she had developed.\\n\\nHer green eyes swept the garden, probing its secret shadows. For whom\\nwas she looking? They rested on mine, absorbed me--then fell away\\nwithout recognition. I had risen in my place, with head bent forward,\\nready to go to her at the least sign of friendship. I remained standing\\nand staring.\\n\\nShe turned to one of her companions and whispered something, at which\\nthey both laughed. He was a tall poetic-looking man, slight of hip,\\nblue-eyed, and handsome. His hair was wavy and yellow, his face bearded,\\nand his skin pale with excess. There were other men with her, Monsieur\\nGeorges among others; but on the poet alone she lavished her attention.\\nShe gave him her arm and came towards me with the undulating stride that\\nI knew so well. For a second I believed she was going to acknowledge me;\\nshe went by so closely that her gown trailed across my feet and brushed\\nmy hands. It was cruelly intended. The play had opened.\\n\\nThe table that had been reserved for her was next to mine, partly hidden\\nfrom the public gaze by bushes; as I watched, I caught glimpses of\\nher profile, and could always hear the lazy murmur of her voice\\nand occasionally fragments of what was said. I followed her foreign\\ngestures, her tricks of personality--all of them adorably familiar: the\\nway she shifted her eyebrows in listening, sunk her chin between her\\nbreasts when she was serious, and clapped her hands in excitement. She\\nwas as simple as a child--in her heart she had not altered. Even the\\nway in which she made me suffer what she had suffered was childish. This\\npretending not to know me was so transparent. There were other and more\\nsubtle methods by which she could have taken her revenge.\\n\\nI was not the only man who attempted to spy on her; there might have\\nbeen no other woman present. Languid faces scattered throughout the\\ngarden took on a new sharpness. They turned and looked down from\\nbalconies on La Fiesole, eager to catch glimpses of her. To their\\nwomen-companions men listened with a bored pretense of attention.\\nPerhaps it was because of this, in an effort to focus interest on\\nthemselves, that the women, as by a concerted plan, became more\\nanimated.\\n\\nSuddenly a girl in scarlet leapt upon a table and commenced to dance\\nwith flashing eyes and whirling skirts. I heard someone say that she was\\na gipsy and that her brother was first-violinist in the orchestra. The\\nmusic mounted up, wild and unrestrained; the small feet beat faster; the\\nactions became more frenzied. She turned away from her comrade and bent\\nback double, peering into his eyes; she flung herself from him, chaffing\\nhim with grim endearments; she feigned to become furious; then she threw\\nherself across his knees exhausted, writhing her arms about his neck.\\nMen eyed her with studied carelessness. She had done it before and they\\nhad applauded. They could see her any night. They could not always feast\\ntheir eyes on La Fiesole.\\n\\nSaturnalia broke loose. Girl after girl rose upon chair or table, or\\nwent swaying through the magic garden like a frail leaf harried by a\\nstorm. They danced singly, they danced together, going through grotesque\\ncontortions, beckoning lovers with their eyes and gestures.\\n\\nAnd I watched Fiesole through the bushes. She was not so indifferent to\\nme as she pretended. She was playacting to rouse my jealousy; she\\nwas purposely scourging me into madness. I alone of the public was\\nsufficiently near to see clearly what she was doing. She was luring her\\npoet to recklessness, taking no notice of what was in process about her.\\nDid I catch her eye, she looked past me without recognition. But him she\\nenticed by her gentleness. The man was drunk with her favor and beauty.\\nHe trembled to put the thoughts of a lover into action; she challenged\\nhim with her eyes, warning him from her and beckoning him to her.\\n\\nStooping over her, so low that his lips were in her hair, he whispered;\\nbut she shook her head. She rested her hand lightly on his shoulder,\\nas though to steady him and to soften the unkindness of her refusal.\\nQuickly he caught it in his own and bent over it, running his lips\\nalong her fingers and up her arm’s smooth curves. She looked down on\\nhim unmoved, disdainful at his breach of manners, yet superbly amorous.\\nClutching her hotly to him, he kissed her on the throat.\\n\\nBlind anger shook me--lust for violence such as I had never felt.\\nBreaking into the toy arbor where they sat, I remember standing over\\nhim, dragging him backward by the collar, so that his face glared up at\\nmine empurpled. His friends rushed forward, beating me about the head\\nand shoulders, tearing at my hands, trying to make me release my hold.\\n\\nFiesole had risen like a fury. The table went down with a crash. Her\\nface was deadly pale and her green eyes blazed with indignation. Her\\nhands were clenched as if she also were about to strike me. And I was\\npouring out a torrent of words, telling her swiftly how I loved her and\\nall that she had made me suffer.\\n\\nHer rage died away as she listened and her expression became\\ninscrutable. Quickly she darted back her head, laughing without\\nhappiness, mockingly. “You are very English, my friend. If you make so\\nmuch noise, these messieurs will think we are married.”\\n\\nI caught her by the wrists, so that she backed away from me. “I wish to\\nGod we were.”\\n\\n“Oh, la, la, la!”\\n\\nShe went off into a peal of merriment, pointing her finger at me. The\\ncrowd gathered round us uncertain, asking in half-a-dozen languages what\\nhad been the provocation and what we were saying.\\n\\nHer look changed. It was as though a mask had fallen. The temptress and\\nwitch were gone. I seemed to see in her melancholy eyes all the longing\\nfor tenderness and loyalty that I thought had been killed years ago in\\nVenice.\\n\\nShe advanced her face to mine and stared at me timidly, as though\\nfearful she had been mistaken.\\n\\n“Take me out of this,” she whispered hoarsely.\\n\\nHer companions tried to intercept us, gesticulating and protesting. She\\nbrushed them aside, explaining that I was not myself and did not\\nknow what I was doing. For her sake they let me go without further\\nmolestation.\\n\\nWe passed out, leaving them gaping after us. I helped her into her\\nfurs and took my place beside her in the coupé. Before we were out of\\nearshot, the gipsy orchestra had swung into a new frenzy.\\n\\nOnce Vi had kept me from Fiesole; now Fiesole was taking me from Vi. And\\nthese two women who, through me, had influenced one another’s destinies,\\nhad never met. They were hostile types.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII--LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI\\n\\nI was at a loss what to say to her. Words could not bridge the gulf of\\nmore than five years that separated us. Now that anger had subsided, my\\ngenius for self-ridicule was at work. What a fool I had made of myself;\\nhow supremely silly I must appear in her eyes! It would be in all the\\npapers to-morrow. How would she like that? Where was she taking me and\\nwhy? Had she come with me simply to get me out of a public place before\\nI committed worse violence?\\n\\nI pieced together phrases of apology and explanation, but remained\\ntongue-tied. To express the emotions that stormed in my mind all words\\nseemed insincere and inadequate. I was not sufficiently certain of her\\nto venture either speech or action. I was fearful lest her mood might\\nchange to one of amusement. My nerves were on edge--I dared not risk\\nthat.\\n\\nNoiseless as a ghost in a dream-world, the electric coupé drifted up the\\ndully gleaming boulevard. I leant against the padded back and watched\\nher. She sat erect, splendidly self-possessed, her profile framed in\\nthe carriage-window with the stealthy lights of Paris slipping by\\nfor background. Now she was no more than a blurred outline; now\\nthe acetylene-lamps of a swiftly moving car flashed on her like a\\nsearch-light; now the twinkling incandescence of an illumined café flung\\njewels in her hair; now her face rested like sculptured ivory on the\\nvelvet blackness of the night. She was immobile; even the slender\\nfingers clasped together in her lap never stirred. Our silence had\\nlasted so long that it had ceased to be fragile; it rose between us, a\\nwall of ice.\\n\\nWe drew up against the curb. I had but a vague idea of where we\\nwere--near the Bois, I conjectured. Tall houses stood in shuttered\\ndumbness along one side; on the other, trees shrank beneath the primrose\\ndusk of arc-lights. She stepped out, ignoring my proffered assistance.\\nShe crossed the pavement and tapped; as the door swung back I followed\\nher under an archway into a dim courtyard. Having mounted several\\nflights of stairs, she tapped again. To the sleepy maid who opened she\\nwhispered hurriedly. The maid discreetly fell behind.\\n\\nWe passed into a room delicately furnished. The floor was heavily\\ncarpeted in red. The walls, hung with etchings and landscapes, were\\npaneled in white. Flowers stood about in bowls and slender vases; shaded\\nlamps gave to the room a secret aspect. In the grate a fire of coals was\\nburning and two deep chairs stood one on either side. The atmosphere\\nwas intensely and perishably feminine; it gave me the feeling of\\npreparedness--as though I had been expected. Through tall windows the\\ncurious night stared in upon us.\\n\\nFiesole crossed, making no sound save the silken rustle of her dress,\\nand drew the curtains close together. She turned, looking back at me\\nside-long, at once amused and languid. Her coldness and aloofness had\\nvanished. The sparkle of mischief fetched the gold from the depths of\\nher green eyes. Her body became expressive and vibrant. Then I heard her\\nsweet hoarse voice, with its quaintly foreign intonation. It reached me\\ntauntingly, lazy with indifference, holding me at arm’s length. “Dear\\nman, take a chair by the fire and behave yourself. Mon Dieu, but you\\nwere amusing to-night!”\\n\\nShe laughed softly at remembering and shook her cloak from her white\\nshoulders. A strand of hair broke loose and fell coiling across her\\nbreast. She stepped to a mirror, turning her back on me; having twisted\\nit into place, she remained smiling at her reflection, whistling beneath\\nher breath.\\n\\nHer gaiety cut like a lash across my mouth. I was painfully in earnest.\\nShe was treating the situation as an incident--a jest. To me it was a\\nsupreme moment--a turning-point: on what we should say to one another\\nwould depend the entire direction of both our lives. I was sorry for her\\nbeyond the power of words to express. The success and luxury of her way\\nof living did not blind me to its hollowness and danger. Her frivolity\\nleft me affronted and fascinated. She roused in me all the unrestraint\\nof the flesh; and yet I desired to worship her with my mind. I longed to\\ncarry her away from the fever and glare of streets to a place of quiet,\\nwhere the world was blowy--where she might become what she had once been\\nwhen I might have had her, genuine and fine. While these thoughts raced\\nthrough my mind, the insistent question kept repeating itself, why had\\nshe brought me here to be alone with her at this late hour of the night?\\n\\nHer eyes flashed out at me maddeningly from the mirror. They prompted to\\nirretrievable folly. They called me to go to her, and to be unworthy\\nof both her and myself. And I knew why: she wished me to say and do the\\nthings that were unforgivable that she might have excuse to scorn me,\\nto fling me from her. Once it had been my Puritanism that had thrust us\\napart; it should not now be my sensualism. I would not let her make a\\nhypocrite of me in my own eyes.\\n\\nThe seconds ticked out the silence. Her dress whispered. Her voluptuous\\nwhite arms, uplifted and curved above her neck as she patted her hair,\\nenhanced the perfect vase-like effect of her body. I would not go\\nto her, I told myself; I would not go to her. I held myself rigid,\\ndistraught, and tense. The blood swelled out my throat and beat in my\\ntemples. She withdrew her hands. Wickedly, like a shower of largesse,\\nthe clustered glory of her hair rained from her head, catching her in a\\nnet of smoldering brightness.\\n\\nShe glanced with half-closed eyes across her shoulder and feigned\\nastonishment at observing that I had remained standing.\\n\\n“Still the same old idjut! Wanting something you’re afraid to have, and\\nlooking tragic.”\\n\\n“Fiesole, girl, don’t you understand? It’s not that.”\\n\\nMy voice sounded odd and strangled. I had spoken scarcely above a\\nwhisper.\\n\\nShe swung about and surveyed me leisurely. There was a pout on her mouth\\nlike that of a naughty child. “You’re no longer amusing,” she faltered;\\n“you grow tiresome. Why can’t you be sensible, and sit down? I want to\\nhear all this that you’ve got to tell me.”\\n\\n“You don’t make it easy.”\\n\\nShe shrugged her gleaming shoulders. “Why should I? You made a horrid\\nrow about something that was none of your concern. You nearly choked a\\nfriend of mine to death. You don’t expect me to say thank you, surely? I\\nought to punish you; instead, I bring you here. I wanted to have a look\\nat you. Ah! but you were funny--so righteous and English! You made me\\nlaugh.... I can forgive anyone who does that.”\\n\\nWhen I did not answer, she regarded me puzzled. Slowly her brilliant\\ndeviltry and merriment faded. The laughter sank to a whisper and\\nceased abruptly, frightened at itself. The red lips drooped and\\nparted. Something of my own pinched earnestness was reflected in her\\nexpression--it was as though her soul unveiled itself. She stole across\\nto me wonderingly, her beautiful arms stretched out. She rested the tips\\nof her fingers tremulously on my shoulders.\\n\\n“No, that’s not true. You were splendid--so different from the rest. I’m\\na beast. You made me ashamed of myself. That’s why I was angry; because\\nyou, who made me what I am, should accuse me.”\\n\\n“Accuse you! God forbid!”\\n\\nI made a movement to gather her to me, but she slipped past me and sank\\ninto a chair.\\n\\n“Between us not that.” She caught her breath. “I hate you. I want to\\nhate you. What else did you expect? But I can’t. I cannot. You won’t let\\nme.”\\n\\n“You ought to hate me. Call me what you like; it won’t be worse than I\\ndeserve. I was cruel and selfish. I see it now.”\\n\\nShe shook back her hair from her forehead and bent forward gazing into\\nthe fire, her elbows on her knees, her face cushioned in her hands.\\nA sudden gravity and wistfulness had fallen on her. She was thinking,\\nremembering, weighing me in the balance. I must not touch her--must not\\nspeak to her. If I showed any sign of passion, she would mistake it for\\npity either of her or of myself.\\n\\n“I wanted to forget--to live you out of my life; but you’ve brought it\\nall back--the old bitterness and heartache. You didn’t know what you did\\nto me, Dante. You spared my body; you killed everything--everything else\\nthat was best. Look at me now.” She glanced down at the exotic daring\\nof her appearance:--the golden stocking that was revealed from ankle to\\nknee by the narrow slash in the skirt; the splendid extravagant display\\nof arms, throat, and breast that swelled up riotously, uninterrupted,\\nsnowy and amorous from the sheathlike dress--a flashing blade\\nhalf-withdrawn from its scabbard.\\n\\n“I’m a devil. You made me that, you virgin man. No, don’t speak----\\nI thought I should have died of shame after I left you. I could have\\nkilled you. You don’t know how a woman feels when she’s wanted a man\\nwith her whole soul and body, and she knows that she’s beautiful; and\\nhe’s flung her from him when she’s offered herself, as though she were\\nworthless. ‘He didn’t care,’ I said, ‘so nobody’ll ever care.’---- And\\nthen I met Antoine Georges, who had known my father. And I did what\\nyou’ve seen and I’ve won success. When I saw you the other night I\\nwanted to make you suffer. I’ve often pictured how I would torture you\\nif ever you should come back--how I’d destroy you--how I’d make you go\\nthrough the same hell. And now you’ve come, and I can’t do it.---- I may\\nchange my mind presently. You’d better go while I let you.”\\n\\n“I’m never going.”\\n\\nShe turned her head, scrutinizing my face stealthily from between her\\nhands.\\n\\n“Don’t be a fool. What about her?”\\n\\n“There’s no one else. There never will be.”\\n\\nShe gasped. “You didn’t marry her?”\\n\\nThe strained look in her face relaxed. She laughed softly to herself;\\nwhy she laughed I could not guess. It was not the laughter which follows\\nsuspense, but the laughter of one who courts danger. It was as though\\nshe parted her hair into sheaves and glanced out crying, “I am Eve, the\\nlong desired.”\\n\\nReaching over to the table she picked out a cigarette. When it was\\nalight, she snuggled down into the chair, kicking off her little gold\\nshoes and resting her feet on the fender. She eyed me dreamily.\\n\\n“Then you made me suffer all that for nothing? You good men can be\\ncruel.---- Tell me.”\\n\\nBriefly I told her of my useless visit to Sheba; and why I left; and why\\nI was still unmarried. I kept nothing back in my self-scorn and desire\\nto be honest.\\n\\nShe slipped her feet up and down the gleaming rail as she listened,\\nlying deep in cushions, her cigarette tilted in her mouth, her hands\\nclasped behind her head. When I ended, she frowned at me whimsically\\nfrom beneath her drawn brows.\\n\\n“But, you impracticable person, you might have foreseen all that. You\\ndidn’t need to cross the Atlantic to discover that a husband doesn’t let\\nhis wife be taken from him without making trouble.---- So you wouldn’t\\npay the price to get her! You’re a rotten reckoner, old boy, for a man\\nwho counts the cost of everything ahead.”\\n\\nHer eye-lids flickered as her deep voice droned the words out.\\n\\n“You should put all that in the past tense, Fiesole. I’m not counting\\nanything to-night, penalties or pleasures. I’m just a man who’s wakened.\\nI want something madly. Whatever it costs me or anybody else, I intend\\nto get it.”\\n\\n“You always wanted what you couldn’t have.”\\n\\nShe spoke lazily, blowing smoke-rings into the air, following them with\\nher eyes and watching how they broke before they reached the ceiling.\\nShe appeared untouched by my emotion, as though nothing had been said\\nthat intimately concerned herself. She let her gaze wander, extending\\nher lithe sweet length luxuriously, as though she had nothing to fear\\nfrom my passion. I was crazed with desire, for all that I kept my tones\\nquiet and steady. She maddened me with her indifference. It was all\\npretense--I knew it. She was playing a part with me, courting the\\ninevitable, tempting me to reveal my hidden self. I watched her with\\nclenched hands--suffering, yet finding fierce joy in the wonderful\\npride of her body. I would not have had her otherwise; the colder she\\nappeared, the more I coveted her. I could have had her once for my\\nwife, I reflected, had I chosen. I had tormented her; it was just that I\\nshould suffer.\\n\\nThe reticence of years fell away from me. I was kneeling at her side,\\nkissing her unshod feet, her hands, her hair. Words tumbled from my\\nlips, broken and unconsidered. I called her by foolish names such as are\\nonly used between lovers. I poured my heart out, speaking of the past\\nand the future. I cursed myself, all the time repeating how I worshiped\\nher--how I had loved her from a boy, but had come to know it only now.\\n\\nAnd she gave no sign of response: neither forbidding, nor assenting;\\nletting me have my way with her without acknowledging my presence; a\\nquiet smile playing round her lips; as completely mistress of herself as\\nis a statue.\\n\\nI trembled into silence. She drooped forward, bending over me, just as\\nshe had done years ago in her uncle’s summer-house.\\n\\n“My dear, there are things that are offered only once. Five years ago I\\nasked you for all that you are now asking. You were afraid of the price,\\nas you were with the other woman. You refused me.”\\n\\n“But it’s marriage I’m asking.”\\n\\n“Ah! Then I asked for less.---- I’m sorry. You ought to have gone when I\\ntold you. I felt that I should have to wound you.”\\n\\nHer gentle dignity stung me into strength. My turbulence died down. As I\\nknelt, I flung my arms around her body and drew her to me. She struggled\\nto draw back, but I held her so closely that my lips were almost on her\\nmouth.\\n\\n“Listen, Fiesole, I’m unfair and I mean to be unfair. I was a brute to\\nyou once when I meant only to be honorable. To-night I’m not caring what\\nI am. You despise me--you can go on despising me, but I’ll wear you\\nout. I’ll make you come to love me even against your will. You’ll need\\nme some day; I shall wait for that. I want to spend all my life for you;\\nit’s the only thing I ask of life now. Wherever you go I shall follow\\nyou.”\\n\\nI stopped, panting for breath. She had ceased to struggle. Her eyes were\\nwide; her face hovered pale above me; she stared down at me powerless,\\nyet with reckless challenge, breathing upon my mouth.\\n\\n“You’re a rotter to come back like this,” she said hotly, “just when I\\nwas beginning to be happy. When you speak of marriage, you don’t know\\nwhat you’re saying. You spoilt all that for me years ago at Venice.\\nD’you think I’ll ever believe again in the honor and goodness of a man?\\nYou’ve come too late. Five years changes people. I’m a different woman\\nnow--not at all what you imagine.”\\n\\n“You can be any kind of woman you choose, but you’re the woman I’m going\\nto marry.”\\n\\n“Then you haven’t heard what people say about me?”\\n\\n“And I don’t care.”\\n\\n“They say I’ve had lovers.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe them.”\\n\\n“What if I should tell you that I have?”\\n\\n“I shouldn’t believe you.”\\n\\n“You’d prefer to think that I’d lied to you rather than that I’d told\\nyou the truth?”\\n\\n“It would make no difference. You’ve always loved me. You love me now. I\\nknow that you are pure.”\\n\\n“And you would never doubt it? Never doubt it of a woman who dances\\nevery night, as I do, before the eyes of Paris?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\nShe gazed at me curiously, with tenderness and intentness. Her bosom\\nshuddered; I saw the sob rising in her throat. When she spoke, the words\\ncame slowly; her eyes were misted over; she trembled as I clasped her.\\n\\n“D’you know, I believe you’re the only living man who’d be fool enough\\nto say that?”\\n\\n“I was always a fool, Fiesole.”\\n\\nI thought she would have kissed me, her lips came so near to mine. “But\\na dear fool, sometimes,” she whispered hoarsely; “a fool who always\\ncomes too late or too early--but a fool to the end.”\\n\\nShe stood up and my arms slipped down to her knees as I held her.\\n\\nShe laughed brokenly. “You nearly made me serious. It won’t do to be\\nserious at three o’clock in the morning.”\\n\\n“I won’t go till you’ve promised. Promise,” I urged.\\n\\nShe yawned. “I’m sleepy. You’ve worn me out.”\\n\\n“But answer me before I go.”\\n\\nShe smiled down at me mockingly, ruffling my hair. “What a hurry he’s in\\nafter all these years. Don’t you ever go to bed?”\\n\\n“Tell me to-night. I must know. I can’t bear the suspense.”\\n\\n“I put up with it for five years.---- Well, if you won’t go home like a\\ngood boy, you won’t. There’s a couch over there.”\\n\\nShe broke from me, leaving me kneeling with my arms empty. As the door\\nopened into the room beyond I had a glimpse of the curtained bed.\\n\\nI drew my chair closer to the dying fire. Behind the wall I could hear\\nher steps moving up and down as she undressed. Now and then they paused;\\nshe was listening for the sound of my departure, uncertain, perhaps,\\nwhether I was still there. Some time had elapsed when the door opened\\ngently. I twisted round. Her room was in darkness. She was standing on\\nthe threshold. Her feet were bare; she was clad in a white night-robe;\\nacross each shoulder, almost to her knees, hung down the red-gold ropes\\nof her braided hair.\\n\\n“I meant what I said. I’m not going till you tell me.”\\n\\nHer green eyes met mine roguishly. “A persistent fool to-night,” she\\nsaid.\\n\\nAs the door was closing I threw after her, “That morning in Venice.... I\\nwas going to have asked you to marry me; you were gone....”\\n\\nLeft alone with the last flame flickering in the grate, I watched the\\nlittle gold shoes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX--THE GARDEN WITHOUT WALLS\\n\\nThe sun was streaming in across my shoulder. Someone had pulled back\\nthe curtains. I was stiff and stupid from my cramped position. Despite\\nthe morning, the electric-lights were still burning in the room;\\nI blinked down at myself and was astonished to find that I was in\\nevening-dress. As I eased myself up, something dropped to the floor--the\\ngold shoes of Fiesole.\\n\\nFrom behind two warm arms fastened themselves about my neck, making me\\nprisoner.\\n\\n“You’re up early, Dante C. You’re a great, stupid juggins to sit up\\nall night and spoil your temper, just when I want you to be more than\\nordinarily pleasant.”\\n\\n“My temper’s not spoilt. Don’t worry.”\\n\\n“I take your word for it. I’ve got a secret to tell you. I’m going on\\nthe spree to-day--going to be immensely happy. I want you to help. If\\nyou’ve any of your tiresome scruples left over, you’d best chuck ’em;\\nor I’ll find someone else.”\\n\\n“Bit early, isn’t it, to tackle a chap? I’m too stupid to know what you\\nmean. But I’m game. How long’s this spree to last?”\\n\\n“Till it ends.”\\n\\n“Then it’ll last forever, so long as it’s just you and me.”\\n\\nShe dug the point of her chin into my shoulder. Glancing sideways,\\nI caught the impish sparkle of her eyes and the glow of her cheeks,\\nflushed with health and excitement.\\n\\n“Perhaps you’d like to kiss me,” she whispered, bringing her demure red\\nlips on a level with my mouth.\\n\\n“And now, perhaps you’d like to kiss me,” I suggested.\\n\\nWhen I attempted to rise, she restrained me. “Not till I’ve made my\\nbargain and you’ve agreed to my terms. I haven’t made up my mind about\\nyou, so you needn’t start talking marriage. Don’t know what I’m going\\nto do with you, Dannie. So you’re to come with me wherever I choose till\\nI’m tired--and you’re to ask no questions. Understand?”\\n\\n“You never will be tired. I’m coming with you always.”\\n\\n“And you’ll ask no questions?”\\n\\n“No more than I can help.”\\n\\nShe released me. I stood up and surveyed my crumpled shirt-front; I was\\nso obviously a reveler who had outstayed discretion. She went off into\\npeals of laughter, laughing all over, showing her small white teeth,\\nand clapping her hands. “What have I done to you? You’re a bottle of\\nchampagne; I’ve pulled the cork out. I’ll never get you all back.”\\n\\nI took her hands in mine, folding them together, and drew her to me.\\n“You’ll never get any of me back. You’ve made me love you. That’s what\\nyou’ve done, you adorable witch-woman.”\\n\\n“Oh, la, la! Don’t talk like that.”\\n\\n“Can’t help it. Don’t want to help it. You’ve made me mad.”\\n\\n“Poor old Dannie! Horrid of me, wasn’t it?”\\n\\nA tap at the door; the maid entered, bringing in rolls and coffee. I\\nstarted away from Fiesole, but she held me. “You can’t shock Marie;\\nshe’s hardened; she’s heard all about you, and some pretty bad things\\nshe’s heard.”\\n\\nOver her coffee she grew thoughtful.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n\\n“You are.”\\n\\n“Already?”\\n\\n“How can I walk through Paris with a man in evening dress at ten in the\\nmorning?”\\n\\n“How d’you want me dressed?”\\n\\n“In something gay. Light tweeds, brown shoes, and a gray felt hat.”\\n\\n“Got ’em all at my hotel. I’ll slip back.”\\n\\nShe slanted her eyes at me. “Slip back to London, perhaps! No, Dannie, I\\ndon’t trust you yet. I don’t intend to lose you.”\\n\\nShe rose from the table and vanished into her bedroom. Marie followed.\\nThrough the partly closed door the excited titter of their whispered\\nconversation reached me, scraps of nervously spoken French, and the\\nopening and shutting of drawers and cupboards.\\n\\nWhen she re-appeared she was clad in a mole- suit of corduroy\\nvelvet, gathered in at the waist and close-fitting to her modish figure.\\nThe tube-skirt hung short to her ankles and was trimmed about with fur.\\nThe suède shoes, open-work stockings, and large muff were to match.\\nNestling close to her auburn hair was a huzzar cap of ermine. She halted\\nin the sunlight, eyeing me with the naughty modesty of a coquette. She\\nlooked oddly young and distinguished on this rare spring morning. There\\nnever was such a woman for arranging her temperament to suit her dress.\\nHer hectic manner of high spirits was abandoned; she seemed almost shy\\nas she raised her muff to her lips and watched me, while I took in the\\neffect.\\n\\n“So I meet with your approval?”\\n\\nPassing down the stairs, she hugged my arm impulsively--a trick which\\nbrought memories of Ruthita. “It’s awfully jolly to be loved--don’t you\\nthink so?”\\n\\nBefore the door a powerful two-seated car was standing. The chauffeur\\nstepped out; Fiesole took his place at the wheel. As we drove down the\\nboulevards she was recognized; people on the pavements paused to gaze\\nback; men raised their hats and threw glances of inquiry at one another\\nas to the identity of her strangely attired companion. We drew up at my\\nhotel in the Rue St. Honoré.\\n\\n“I give you fifteen minutes. Is that sufficient? Make yourself gay.\\nDon’t forget, a tweed suit, brown shoes, a gray felt hat--oh, and a red\\ntie if you’ve got one. I couldn’t endure anything black.”\\n\\nI found her with her eager face turned towards the doorway, watching\\nimpatiently for me.\\n\\n“A good beginning--ready to the second. Jump in. We’re off to somewhere\\nwhere no one’ll know anything about us. Let’s see if we can’t lose\\nourselves.”\\n\\nShe swung the car round and away we snorted, through the Place de la\\nConcorde blanched in sunlight, up the Champs Elysées where sunlight\\nspattered against blossoming trees and lay in pools on the turf. The\\nstreets were animated with little children, women in bright dresses,\\ndashing cars and carriages. Paris gleamed white and green and golden.\\nOverhead the sky foamed and bubbled, yawning into blue and primrose\\ngulleys, trampled by stampeding clouds.\\n\\nAt the Place de l’Etoile the car drew up sharply and skidded; circled\\nlike a hound picking up the scent; then darted swiftly away to the Bois,\\nwhere fashionables already loitered and acacias trembled murmurously.\\n\\nFiesole was radiant with impatience. A goddess of speed, she bent above\\nthe wheel, casting her eyes along the road ahead. Did a gap occur in the\\ntraffic, she flung the car forward, driving recklessly, yet always with\\ncalculated precision. I marveled at her nerve and the silent power that\\nlay hidden in her thin, fine hands.\\n\\nAs we shot the bridge at St. Cloud the pace quickened. It was as though\\nshe shook Paris from her skirts and ran panting to meet wider stretches\\nof wind-bleached country. I had one vivid glimpse of the ribbon of\\nblue river, boat-dotted, winding through young green of woodlands; then\\ncities and sophistication, and all things save Fiesole, myself, and the\\nfuture were at an end.\\n\\nSoon the white road curved uninterrupted before us, a streak between\\npollarded trees and blown meadows. Over the horizon came bounding hills\\nand church-spires, villages and rivers; as they came near to us they\\nhalted, like shy deer, for a second; when we drew level, they fled. It\\nwas as though we were stationary and the world was rushing past us.\\n\\nThe wind of our going brought color to her cheeks and fluttered out her\\nhair. Her eyes were starry, fixed on the distance as she skirted the\\nrim of eternity in her daring. Should an axle break or a tire burst,\\nall this fire of youth would be extinguished forever. I glanced at\\nthe speedometer; it quivered from seventy to eighty, to eighty-five\\nkilometers, and there it hovered.\\n\\nThe throb of the engine seemed the throb of my passion. We were\\ntraveling too fast for talking. She did not want to talk; she was\\nescaping from something, memories, perhaps--hers and mine. In her modern\\nway she was expressing what I had always felt: the tedium of captivity,\\nsameness, and disappointment--the need for the unwalled garden, where\\nbarriers of obedience and duty are broken down.\\n\\nAt Evreux we halted for petrol. I proposed déjeuner, she shook her head\\nnaughtily.\\n\\n“Where are we going?”\\n\\n“Over there, to the West.”\\n\\n“Any particular spot in the West?”\\n\\n“You’ll see presently.”\\n\\n“How about the theatre?”\\n\\n“Time enough,” she said.\\n\\nShe spoke breathlessly, remaining at the wheel while the man was filling\\nthe tank. Somehow it seemed to me that the town had come between us; we\\nunderstood one another better when the garden of the world was flying\\npast us.\\n\\nBefore the man was paid, she had turned on the power. As we lunged\\nforward, he jumped aside and I flung the money out. Our wild ride\\ntowards the Eden of the forbidden future recommenced.\\n\\nPresently, without turning her head, she broke the silence. “Slip your\\narm round me, old boy; my back grows tired.”\\n\\nI placed my arm about the slender, upright figure and slid my shoulder\\nbehind her, so she leant against me.\\n\\n“What’s the idea, Fiesole? Paolo and Francesca?”\\n\\n“And Adam and Eve, if you like; and Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell; and\\nJoseph Parker and Jane Cake-bread. Anything, so long as we keep going.”\\n\\nWhen I attempted to speak again, she turned on more power and threw me a\\nsmile which was a threat.\\n\\nI clasped her closer. “Little devil! I’ll keep quiet. You needn’t do\\nthat.”\\n\\nBut though I kept quiet my heart beat madly. The panorama of change\\nsweeping by, with her face the one thing constant, quickened and\\nemphasized my need of her more than any spoken tenderness. Our thoughts\\nmerged and interchanged with a subtlety that speech could never have\\naccomplished. The pressure of her body, the tantalizing joy of\\nher nearness and forbiddenness, the imminence of death, the law of\\nsilence--these summed up in a moment’s experience the entire philosophy\\nof love, and of life itself.\\n\\nI began to understand her meaning, her language; she was temporizing as\\nI had temporized at Venice; but instead of going away from me, she was\\nfleeing with me from circumstance. She was telling me of her woman’s\\npride--her difficulty to make herself attainable after what had\\nhappened. She loved me and she hated me. She drew me to her and she\\nthrust me from her. She could not forget and she dreaded to remember.\\nAnd she said all this when, in escaping, she took me with her.\\n\\nNow I saw nothing of the hurrying landscape; I watched her. I wrote all\\nher beauty on the tablets of my mind--nothing should be unremembered:\\nthe way her curls crept from under her cap and fluttered about her\\ntemples; the clear pallor of her forehead; the firm, broad brows; the\\nquiet challenge of her deep-lashed eyes; how her red mouth pouted and\\nher head leant forward from her frail white neck, like a flower from\\nits stalk, in a kind of listening expectancy. And I observed the tender\\nswelling of her breasts, high and proud, yet humble for maternity; and\\nthe pliant strength of her supple body; and her long clean limbs; and\\nthe delicately modeled feet and ankles, which shot out from beneath\\nher fur-trimmed skirt--the feet of a dancer, graceful and fragile as\\nviolins.\\n\\nI was mad. I wanted her. No matter how she came to me, I wanted her. I\\ncould not bear the thought that we should ever be separated. She was\\nso intensely mine at this present; and yet, though she was mine, I was\\ninsanely jealous to preserve her.\\n\\nWith the long fascination of watching her I bent slowly forward. The\\naction was instinctive, uncalculated. How long I took in approaching\\nher, I cannot tell. I was anxious to last out the joy of anticipation; I\\nwas not conscious of motion. My lips touched hers. Her hold on the wheel\\nrelaxed. Her eyes met mine. The car swerved, hung upon the edge of the\\nroad, ran along it balancing; then bounded back into the straight white\\nline.\\n\\nI was so frenzied that I did not care. She had thought to hold me\\nprisoner by her speed; I would overcome her with defiance. I kissed her\\nagain, holding her to me. She kept her eyes on the distance now, but her\\nmouth smiled tenderly.\\n\\n“That was foolish,” she said.\\n\\nI raised my voice to reach her above the moaning of the engine. “The\\nwhole thing’s foolish.”\\n\\nShe broke into wild laughter. “That’s why I like it, like you, like\\nmyself.”\\n\\nWe hovered on the brim of a valley; then commenced to sink as though the\\nearth had given way beneath us. Far below, as far as eye could reach,\\nwere orchards smoking with white blossom. Through the heart of the\\nvalley a river ran; standing on its puny banks was a gray old town,\\nblinking in the wind and sun like a spectacled grandmother who had\\nnodded to sleep, and wakened bewildered to find spring rioting round\\nher.\\n\\n“Where is it?”\\n\\n“Lisieux, unless I’m mistaken.”\\n\\n“Then you know where we’re going?”\\n\\n“More or less.”\\n\\nWe pulled up in a drowsy, sun-drenched market-place outside a sleepy\\ncafé. At tables on the pavement, with hands in their blouses and legs\\nsprawled out, sat a few artisans, eyeing their absinthe. Houses tottered\\nand sagged from extreme old age. Across the way a cathedral, scarred\\nby time and chapped by weather, raised its crumbling sculptured towers\\nagainst the clouds.\\n\\nShe took my hand as she stepped out. “You nearly did for us just now.”\\n\\n“Who cares?”\\n\\nShe shrugged her shoulders. “All Paris cares. I’m not anxious to be\\ndead; when I am, I’d like to look pretty.”\\n\\nWhen we had seated ourselves, she took out her mirror and commenced\\ntidying her hair and brushing the dust from her brows. There was nothing\\nto be had, the waiter informed us, but pot au feu; déjeuner was over. So\\nI ordered pot au feu, red wine and an omelet.\\n\\nAs she replaced her mirror in her muff, she looked up brilliantly. “You\\nknow, I _am_ pretty.”\\n\\nShe was being watched. The dull eyes of the absinthe-drinkers had become\\nalert. Tradesmen had come out of their shops and stared at her across\\nthe square. Some of the bolder strolled into the café and seated\\nthemselves close to her. They were paying the unabashed homage that a\\nFrenchman always pays to feminine beauty.\\n\\nI lowered my voice to a whisper; my throat was parched with dust. “This\\ncan’t go on.”\\n\\nShe laughed with her eyes. “It can go on as long as there’s any petrol\\nleft, and as long as you don’t try to kiss me when I’m speeding.”\\n\\n“That’s not what I meant; you know it.”\\n\\n“What then? The same old thing--marriage?”\\n\\nI ignored her flippancy. “You’ll be turning back directly, and when you\\nget to Paris, you won’t be like you are now. You’ll be _La Fiesole_ and\\nto-night you’ll be dancing with them all watching. I can’t bear it.”\\n\\n“I shan’t.”\\n\\nI leant eagerly forward, but she drew away from me.\\n\\n“You’re not going back? You’ve given up the theatre?”\\n\\nShe held me in suspense, letting her eyes wander as though she had not\\nheard. Slowly she turned, with that lazy, taunting smile of hers. “Damn\\nthe theatre,” she said quietly; “I’m going on with you to the end.”\\n\\n“And the end’s marriage?”\\n\\n“Who can tell? Now don’t be a rotter. You’re spoiling everything. Let’s\\ntalk of something else.”\\n\\nWhen we climbed into the car, “You drive,” she said.\\n\\n“But to where?”\\n\\n“That’s my secret. Straight on. I’ll tell you when to turn.”\\n\\nWe were hardly out of the valley before her eyes had closed and her head\\nwas nodding against my shoulder. I drove gently, fearing to disturb her.\\nFrom time to time I looked down at the white slant of her throat, the\\nshadows beneath her lashes, and the almost childish droop of her mouth.\\nHow the self she kept hidden revealed itself! Her face was that of a\\nMadonna, for whom the cross was yet remote and the happiness near at\\nhand--and both were certain. What different versions she gave me of\\nherself! Once a sickening fear shook me like a leaf. I slowed the car to\\na halt, and listened for her breath. In that moment I suffered all the\\nagony of loss that must some time accompany the actuality. One day,\\nsooner or later, I told myself, this thing I had dreaded would occur.\\nHow much time was left to us to find life beautiful between then and\\nnow?\\n\\nOn the bare Normandy uplands, between tilled fields and driving clouds,\\nI waited for her to waken. The air was growing chill; I drew my coat\\nround her. I felt again, in a new and better way, that sense of nearness\\nand forbiddenness which had exhilarated me to the point of delirium\\non the madcap journey down from Paris. I looked ahead into the pale\\ndistance, where the notched horizon bound the earth with a silver band...\\n and I wondered where she was taking me, and what lay at the end. She\\nmight fight against it--she would fight against it; but the end should\\nbe marriage. I would watch over her always as I was watching now.\\n\\nShe stirred; her eye-lids fluttered. She stared up at me for a moment\\nwith undisguised affection; then the fear of tenderness returned. She\\npulled herself together, rubbing her knuckles in her eyes and yawning.\\n\\n“Gee up, old hoss. This ain’t a bloomin’ cab-stand. You’re not home\\nyet.”\\n\\n“You fell asleep, my dear, so I waited for you.”\\n\\n“Well, I shan’t pay you,” she laughed; “it’s not fair. Pray what did you\\nthink you were doing?”\\n\\n“Enjoying myself.”\\n\\n“There’s the difference; you like to crawl, I like to hurtle. You’re a\\ntortoise; I’m a razzle-dazzle. We’re an ill-matched pair. Living in Pope\\nLane has made you pontifical. Oh, Dannie, in ten years your tummy’ll be\\nbulgy and your head’ll be bald. Pope Lane’ll have done it. I know what\\nI’ve always missed about you now.”\\n\\n“Something horrid? Let’s have it.”\\n\\n“A cowl. You ought to have been a monk in Florence, painting naked\\nangels in impossible meadows.”\\n\\n“So kind of you. Religion mixed with impropriety! If there was someone\\nto relieve me of my conscience, it wouldn’t be half bad. But I don’t\\nlive at Pope Lane any longer. You have the honor of sitting beside Sir\\nDante Cardover of Woadley Hall, Ransby, of which, you little wretch, you\\nare soon to be mistress.”\\n\\n“That so? Sorry I spoke. Jump out and crank up the engine. It’s coming\\non again--you’re going to have the sentimentals, and you’re going to\\nhave ’em bad.”\\n\\n“I’ve known you sentimental, Fiesole.”\\n\\nHer lips trembled, and her body stiffened. “And you punished me for it.”\\n\\n“You have a woman’s memory.”\\n\\n“Odd, seeing I’m a woman. Who’s going to crank that engine? Am I, or are\\nyou?”\\n\\nWe swung on through the bare bleak country with masked faces. She sat\\na little apart from me, her knees crossed and her hands clasped about\\nthem. Did I glance at her, she turned petulantly in the opposite\\ndirection. I cursed myself. I was almost angry with her. What was her\\nplan? Had she given me the privileges of dearness to her simply that she\\nmight thwart and taunt me? How could I teach her to forget? How could\\nI teach myself to forget? At the back of my mind I loved her the more\\nbecause of her perversity.\\n\\nWe came to a cross-road. She touched me on the arm; we swerved into it.\\nFar down the white stretch I saw a speck, which resolved itself into a\\nman and woman, traveling away from us with their backs towards us. The\\nman wore the blue blouse and wide, baggy trousers of a peasant; his feet\\nwere shod in sabots. The woman was clad in a coarse, loose dress, like\\na sack drawn over her and tied about the middle; it was neutral in tone,\\nbeing aged by weather. Her figure was shapeless--almost animal in its\\nponderous patience and breadth. Her hair was flaxen from exposure. They\\nplodded through the bleak expanse with heads bowed, bodies huddled, and\\narms encircling. Every few paces they halted; we saw the gleam of their\\nfaces as they clung lip to lip in hasty ecstasy.\\n\\nThe wind was blowing from them towards us; they were unaware of us. I\\nhad my hand on the horn, when Fiesole clutched me.\\n\\n“Don’t. They’ve nothing in the world but this moment. God knows what\\nlies before them!”\\n\\nWe followed them at a distance. The symbolism of their silent figures\\nawed us: overhead, the soundless battle of high-flying clouds; beneath,\\nthe gray vacancy with springtime stirring; around, the dun, unheeding\\nearth; through the bareness the white road sweeping on unhurrying toward\\nthe land of sunsets; traveling along it a man and woman, for the time\\nforgetful of their poverty, the focus-point of responsive passion. They\\nhad nothing but this moment.\\n\\n“And what have we?” I questioned.\\n\\nShe crouched beside me; her soft arm stole about my neck. “Dearest,\\nforgive me,” she murmured.\\n\\nHer eyes were blinded; my lips against her cheek were salt. She clung\\nto me desperately, as though a hand pressed on her shoulder to jerk her\\nfrom me--Vi’s hand.\\n\\nWhere a rutted lane sloped down to a wooded hollow, the lovers turned.\\nAmong pollarded trees we lost them. They would never know that we had\\nwatched them. So they vanished out of our lives, walking hand-in-hand\\ntoward child-bearing and the inevitable separation of death that lurked\\nfor them at some hidden cross-road. We, equally unknowing, to what place\\nof parting were we faring?\\n\\nI tilted up her face. “I’ve been a selfish fool. I’ll never speak\\nanother word about marriage or anything that will pain you. Oh, Fiesole,\\nif you could only love me--love me as I love you--as though there was\\nnothing else left!” She took my hands in her small ones, pressing them\\nto her breast, quoting in a low sing-song, “Laugh, for the time is\\nbrief, a thread the length of a span. Laugh and be proud to belong to\\nthe old proud pageant of man.”\\n\\n“I like that--‘the old proud pageant of man.’ I wonder where you got it.\\nBut is there to be nothing deeper between us than laughter?”\\n\\n“If we do the laughing,” she said, “life’s ready to do the rest. But\\nyou’re a puritan at heart: you suspect that gladness is somehow unholy.\\nDon’t you know, Mr. Bunyan, that laughter is the language they speak in\\nheaven?”\\n\\n“I don’t; neither do you. But when you say so laughing, I can almost\\nbelieve it.”\\n\\nWhen we had once again started, she became more frank. It was because\\nmy hands were occupied, perhaps. Laying her cheek against my shoulder,\\n“Dante, I’m not a flirt,” she said. “I just can’t make up my mind about\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Maybe, I’ll make it up for you.”\\n\\n“Maybe. But I want you to understand why I did what I did this\\nmorning--speeding like that and behaving as though I was cracked. I was\\nafraid you were going to make love to me every moment--and I didn’t want\\nit.”\\n\\n“D’you want it now?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.” She dragged the words out wide-apart. “And yet I do\\nknow; but I’ve no right to allow it.”\\n\\n“You silly child, why on earth not?”\\n\\n“I’m inconstant; I’m like that now. I should make you happy first and\\nsorry afterwards.”\\n\\n“I’ll risk it. I made you sorry first and now I’m going to make you\\nhappy.”\\n\\n“Do you think you are?”\\n\\n“Sure of it.”\\n\\nThe road began to descend, at first gradually. The bare, tilled uplands\\nwhere winter lingered, were left behind and we ran through a sheltered\\nland of orchards. The air pulsated with the baaing of lambs and the\\nsweet yearning of fecundity. Under blown spray of fruit-trees the\\nlittle creatures gamboled, halting by fits and starts, calling to their\\nmothers, or kneeling beneath them, their thirsty throats stretched up\\nand their long tails flapping. Surrounded by lean trees, lopped of their\\nlower branches, gray farmhouses rose up, watching like aged shepherds.\\nSlowfooted cattle, heavy-uddered, wandered between the hedges with their\\ngreat bags swinging. Women with brass jars on their shoulders, which\\nnarrowed at the neck like funeral urns, walked through the meadows to\\nthe milking.\\n\\n“Do we turn or go on?”\\n\\n“Go on.”\\n\\n“How much farther?”\\n\\n“A little farther.”\\n\\n“It’s getting older and older isn’t it, Fiesole?”\\n\\n“No, younger and younger, stupid. Look at all the lambs.”\\n\\nBefore us the land piled up into a hillock, breaking the level sweep of\\nsky-line and hiding what lay beyond. The road curved about it in a slow\\ndescent.\\n\\nFiesole leant past me, shutting off the power. “Let her coast,” she\\nsaid.\\n\\nAt the bend in the road I jammed on the brakes, halting the car. She\\nslipped her hand into mine; we filled our eyes with the sight, saying\\nnothing.\\n\\nSheer against the sky rose a jagged rock and perched on its summit, so\\nmuch a part of it that it seemed to have been carved, stood a ruined\\ncastle. Its windows were vacant; its roof had long since fallen; its\\nwalls had been bruised and broken by cannon. It tottered above the\\nvalley like a Samson blinded, groping on the edge of the precipice, its\\npower shorn. Round the embattled rock, like children who trusted the old\\nprotector, gathered mediaeval houses. Some of them, centuries ago,\\nhad wandered off into the snowy orchards and stood tiptoe, as though\\nlistening, ready to run back should they hear the tramp of an invading\\narmy. Through the valley and into the town a narrow stream darted,\\nflashing like an arrow. Behind town and castle, across the horizon,\\ntowered a saffron wall of cloud, tipped along the edge with fire and\\nnotched in the center where the molten ball of the setting sun rested.\\nFrom quaint gray streets came up a multitude of small sounds, like the\\nlazy humming of women spinning. And over all, across orchards and roofs\\nof houses, the grim warden on the rock threw his shadow. It was a valley\\nforgotten by the centuries--a garden without barriers.\\n\\n“Where are we?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Falaise, my darling. I always promised myself that if ever I should\\nlove a man, I would bring him to Falaise to love him. Can’t you feel\\nit--the slow quiet, the sense of the ages watching?”\\n\\nShe was aflame in the light of the sunset. Her face was ivory, intense\\nand ardent with glory. Her waywardness and fondness for disguise were\\ngone; her true self, steady and unafraid, gazed out on me. The havoc of\\npassion was replaced by the contentment of a desire all but satisfied.\\n\\n“Let’s go to the castle first,” she said. “You remember its story?”\\n\\nI remembered: how Robert the Devil, Duke of the Normans, had found\\nArlotta, the tanner’s daughter, washing linen in that same little beck;\\nand had loved her at sight and had carried her off to his castle on\\nthe rock, where was born William the Bastard, conqueror of England and\\ngreatest of all the Normans.\\n\\nLeaving the car in the village street, we climbed the rock and gained\\nadmittance. As we gazed down from the splintered battlements into the\\nwinding streets, Fiesole drew me to her, throwing her arm carelessly\\nabout my neck as though we were boy and girl.\\n\\n“Look,” she whispered, pointing sheer down to the foot of the precipice,\\n“there’s the tannery still standing and the beck running past it. And\\nsee, there are girls washing linen; one of them might be Arlotta. In\\nnine hundred years nothing has altered.”\\n\\nWe stole across the threshold of the stone-paved room in which the\\nConqueror was born. “I’m going to shock you,” she said. “I always think\\nof Falaise as another Bethlehem--the Bethlehem of war. The Bethlehem of\\npeace has crumbled, shattered by war; but here’s Falaise unchanged since\\nthe day when Robert the Devil seized Arlotta and galloped up the rock,\\nand bolted his castle door. It sets one thinking----”\\n\\n“Thinking something dangerous, I’ll warrant.”\\n\\nShe brushed the rebellious curls from her forehead and leant back\\nagainst the wall laughing. “Thinking all kinds of thoughts: that it pays\\nbest in this world to steal what you want.”\\n\\n“Perhaps--if you steal strongly.”\\n\\n“But I have stolen strongly; see how I’ve carried you off.”\\n\\nWe discovered a little hotel, the courtyard of which was invaded by\\na garden and opened out beyond into a misty orchard. At sound of our\\nentrance a white-haired old country-woman came out from the office,\\nholding her knitting in her hands. I made to go towards her, but Fiesole\\ndetained me. “You’re my prisoner,” she said; “I’m responsible. You stay\\nhere and I’ll tell her what we want.”\\n\\nThe air had grown sharper, but the moments were too precious to be spent\\nindoors. We had our dinner served beneath a fig-tree in the courtyard,\\nwhere we could see the shadows creeping through the garden and hear the\\nsabots clap along the causeways.\\n\\nWe were almost shy with one another. We had little to say, and that\\nlittle was spoken with our eyes for the most part. We did not dare to\\nthink: for me there was the ghost of Vi; and she also had I knew not\\nwhat memories. We were restless till the meal was ended; the contact of\\nlive hands was the best speech possible. The tremulous dusk had fallen\\nwhen we wandered out into the narrow climbing streets, traveling\\ndirectionless under broken archways, past ancient churches--bribes to\\nGod for forgiveness for wrongs still more ancient.\\n\\nWe peeped into crouching cottages as we passed. We were glad of their\\ncompany; they kept us from giving way to the tumult of feeling that ran\\nriot in our hearts. Their small leaded windows were like lanterns set\\nout to guide and not to watch us. We had glimpses through the glowing\\npanes of kindly peasant interiors, with low ceilings and home-made\\nfurnishings. Sometimes at a rough table round which wine and bread were\\npassed, the family was gathered, their faces illumined by a solitary\\ncandle in the center; looming out of the shadows on the wall was the\\ncross. Sometimes the man was still at work, carving sabots or weaving,\\nwhile the woman held a child to her breast, or rocked it in a cradle on\\nthe stone-paved floor.\\n\\nOne by one the lights were quenched and the doors fastened.\\n\\nFiesole leant more heavily against me, her arm encircling me, her head\\nupon my shoulder. Now that the town slept, I could feel the wild clamor\\nof her body and hear the fluttering intake of her breath. The wind,\\nwhispering through flowering trees, blew cool and fragrant in our\\nnostrils. For intervals there was no sound save the rustle of falling\\nblossoms and our own stealthy footsteps; from somewhere out in the pale\\ndusk, a lamb would call and its mother would answer. Above us, between\\nsteep roofs, as down a beaten pathway, the silver chariot of the moon\\nplunged onward, scattering the clouds before it.\\n\\nWe came again to the hostel; when we entered, we walked apart. Quickly,\\nas though seized with sudden misgiving, Fiesole left me. I heard her\\nfootstep mounting the stairs and saw the light spring up in her window.\\nEvery other window was in darkness. From where I sat in the courtyard I\\ncould see the shadow of her figure groping, and her arms uplifted as she\\nunbound her hair. The light went out. I wondered if she watched me. I\\nlistened to hear her stirring; I could hear nothing.\\n\\nIn the dim quiet, shut out from the excitement of her presence, I had\\nleisure to reflect on whither I was going. I drew apart from myself and\\neyed my doings impartially. It was a whim of curiosity that had brought\\nme to Paris--one of those instinctive decisions which construct a\\ndestiny. The sight of her as Lucrezia had stabbed me to remorse, and\\nthen to folly. That she had hated me up to last night and that the\\ndesire of her wild heart had been to torture me, I did not doubt; but I\\nthought that there were moments in this day when she had loved me with\\nthe old uncalculating kindness. What was her intention now?\\n\\nUnaccountably out of the past, Fiesole had returned--Fiesole, the\\ngirl-woman I had loved as a boy before Vi. I felt like a broken gamester\\nwho has discovered an overlooked coin in his pocket after having\\nbelieved himself penniless. So strange was this happening that it could\\nnot be fortuitous--we had met because we had been piloted.\\n\\nAll seeming failure of the past would take on an aspect of design\\nand would appear a straight road leading to this moment, were our\\njourneyings to end in marriage. And, though she would not own it, she\\nneeded the protection of a man who loved her to guard her against her\\nsuccess and self-reliance.\\n\\nMy thoughts ran on, picturing the home and little children we would\\nhave. Children would be walls about our love, making it secure. For\\nthese I was hungry--desperately afraid lest the hope of them should be\\nwithdrawn. In imagination they seemed already mine, I would speak my\\nheart out: she should understand before it was too late that my need was\\nalso hers.\\n\\nI entered the hostel. In the office the old woman nodded above her\\nknitting. I roused her and asked for my candle.\\n\\n“Ah, Monsieur,” she said in apology, “I had not thought. For a room so\\nsmall I supposed that one would be sufficient. I have given Madame the\\ncandle. If Monsieur will wait, I will fetch another.”\\n\\nIn my surprise I told her that it did not matter.\\n\\nI felt my way up the unlit stairs. At the bedroom-door I knocked.\\nFiesole’s voice just reached me, whispering to me to enter. On the\\nthreshold I paused, peering into the darkness. The floor was bare;\\nthere was little furniture. In the shadows against the wall, a canopied,\\nhigh-mattressed bed loomed mountainous. Through the window, reaching\\nalmost to my feet, a ray of moonlight slanted; in it, gleaming white,\\nstood Fiesole.\\n\\nMy heart was in my throat. I could not speak. We watched one another; as\\nthe silence lengthened, the space between us seemed impassable.\\n\\nShe held out her arms; her hoarse voice spoke, yearning towards me with\\nits lazy sweetness. “Even now, if you want to, you may go, Dannie.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X--THE FRUIT OF THE GARDEN\\n\\nI had been for a saunter through the town. Several times I had returned\\nbefore I found Fiesole beneath the fig-tree in the courtyard, seated at\\nthe table with a paper spread out in front of her. She looked up swiftly\\nat sound of my footstep and threw me a smile, gathering herself in to\\nmake room for me beside her. When I stood over her, she lifted up her\\nface with childish eagerness as though we had not kissed already more\\nthan once that morning. “Shall I order déjeuner out here?”\\n\\nShe nodded. “Where else, but in the sunshine?” When I came back from\\ngiving the order, her red-gold head was bent again above the paper.\\n\\n“Something interesting?”\\n\\n“Rather.” She raised her green eyes mischievously. “It’s all up. We’ll\\nbe collared within the hour.”\\n\\n“What’s all up? Who’s got the right to collar us?”\\n\\n“Paris thinks it has, the whole of France thinks it has, but\\nmost particularly Monsieur Georges thinks he has, and so does the\\ntheatre-management.”\\n\\n“Let ’em try. We don’t care.”\\n\\n“But, old boy, I do care a little. You see, I shouldn’t have been here\\nnow if it hadn’t been for Monsieur Georges, Paris, and the rest of them.\\nThey gave me my chance; going off like this has left them in the lurch.\\nIt isn’t playing the game, as I understand it.”\\n\\n“If it’s damages for a broken contract they’re after, I’ll settle that\\nfor you.”\\n\\nShe smiled mysteriously and, bowing her head above the paper, read me\\nextracts, throwing in, now and then, her own vivacious comments.\\n\\nIt appeared that up to the last moment the theatre-management had\\nexpected her and had allowed the audience to assemble. They had delayed\\nmatters for half an hour while they sent out messengers to search for\\nher. When the crowd grew restless, they had commenced the performance\\nwith an under-study. But the people would have none of her; they rose up\\nin their places stamping and threatening, shouting for _La Fiesole_.\\nThe curtain had been rung down and Monsieur Georges had come forward,\\nweeping and wringing his hands, saying that _La Fiesole_ had been\\nkidnaped by an admirer that morning. Pandemonium broke loose. The\\ntheatre for a time was in danger of being wrecked; but the police were\\nsummoned and got the audience out, and the money refunded.\\n\\nThe journalist’s story followed of the unknown Englishman who, a few\\nnights before, had stood up in his box applauding when everyone else\\nhad grown silent; and how the same Englishman, one night previously, had\\ncreated a scene between himself and _La Fiesole_ at a café in the Champs\\nElysées--a scene which had terminated by them going away together.\\n\\n“Make you out quite a desperate character, don’t they, old darling?” she\\ndrawled, looking up into my eyes, laughing.\\n\\nI did my best to share her levity, but I was secretly annoyed at so\\nmuch publicity. Taking the paper from her, I patted her on the shoulder.\\n“Come, drink up your coffee, little woman; it’s getting cold. Why waste\\ntime over all this nonsense? You’re out of it. It’s all ended.”\\n\\n“But it isn’t. Paris won’t let it be ended. They’re making more row\\nabout me than they did about La Gioconda. They’ve offered a reward of\\nfive thousand francs for my recovery.”\\n\\n“And if they did find us, they couldn’t do anything. Discovery won’t be\\neasy.”\\n\\n“Won’t it? We were seen yesterday going together towards St. Cloud;\\nthey’ve got the number of my car and particulars of my dress from\\nMarie.”\\n\\n“But didn’t you warn Marie?”\\n\\n“Silly fellow, how should I? Didn’t know myself what I was going to do\\nwhen we started--at least I didn’t know positively.”\\n\\n“Humph!”\\n\\n“Ripping, isn’t it, for a chap like you as ’as allaws lived decent and\\n’oped to die respected? Dannie, Dannie, you’re a regular Robert the\\nDevil--only I stole you, and nobody’ll ever believe it.”\\n\\n“It doesn’t matter what they say about me; it’s your good name that\\nmatters.--I promised yesterday never to speak another word about\\nmarriage. May I break my promise?”\\n\\n“You’ve done it. Go on, John Bunyan.”\\n\\n“Well, here’s my plan: that we motor through to Cherbourg and skip over\\nto Southampton.”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“Get a special license in the shortest time possible. When we’re\\ndiscovered, you’ll be Lady Cardover.”\\n\\n“But it isn’t necessary that I should be Lady Cardover. I’m not ashamed\\nof anything. Are you?”\\n\\n“Perhaps not; but there’s nothing to be gained by dodging the\\nconventions. I ought to know; I’ve been dodging ’em ever since I\\ncan remember. I’ve come to see that there’s something grand about\\nconventions; they’re a sort of wall to protect someone you love dearly\\nfrom attack. We’re man and wife already by everything that’s sacred; but\\nwe shall never be securely happy unless we’re married.”\\n\\nOur meal was finished. We wandered off into the orchard at the back.\\nWhen we were safe from watching eyes, Fiesole gave me her hand. We came\\nto a place where trees grew closer together; here we rested. She leant\\nagainst me, her face wistful and troubled; the sun through the branches\\nscattered gold and the blossoms snowflakes in her hair.\\n\\nPresently she disentangled herself from my arms, and jumped to her feet,\\nsmiling gently. “I’ve a surprise for you, my virgin man. I want you to\\nstop here for half an hour and promise not to follow.”\\n\\n“A long time to be without you.”\\n\\n“But promise.”\\n\\n“All right. Very well.”\\n\\nShe stooped over me quietly before she went. I watched her pass swaying\\nacross the dappled turf, under the dancing shadows and rain of petals.\\nJust before she entered the courtyard, she turned and waved her hand.\\n\\nSomething in Fiesole’s distant aspect, something of seeming maidenly\\ndaintiness, brought to mind another woman--gold and ivory, with poppies\\nfor her lips, were the words which had described her. While I had walked\\nFalaise that morning I had striven to banish her from my thoughts.\\nAnd now Fiesole, from whom I had hoped to obtain forgetfulness, Fiesole\\nherself had unconsciously reminded me.\\n\\nIn the stillness I confronted myself: I was being faithless to the\\nloyalty of years--I had done and was about to do a thing which was\\ntraitorous to all my past. Vi’s memory, though in itself sinful, had\\ndemanded chastity from me.\\n\\nYet my present conduct was not incompatible with my past: it was\\nthe result of it. Puppy passions of thought had grown into hounds of\\naction--that was all.\\n\\nFrom the first my pagan imagination, at war with my puritan conscience,\\nhad lured me on. All my life I had been breaking bounds imaginatively:\\ninnocently for Ruthita in my childhood; in appearance for Fiesole at\\nVenice; dangerously for Vi; and at last in fact for Fiesole. Narrower\\naffections I had passed by, not perceiving that their narrowness made\\nfor safety and kindness. The unwalled garden of masterless desire had\\nproved a wilderness; its fruit was loneliness.\\n\\nLast night, sitting in the courtyard, I had told myself that in\\nremaining constant to Vi, I had gambled for the impossible. Was it true?\\nIn any case, to have followed up the risk strongly was my only excuse\\nfor having gambled at all. By turning back I abandoned the prize, and\\nmade the sin of loving a forbidden woman paltry.--Might she not have\\nbeen waiting for me all these years, as I had been waiting! What an\\nirony if now, when I was destroying both the hope and reward of our\\nsacrifice, she were free and preparing to come to me!\\n\\nAnd Fiesole! I had used her to drug my unsatisfied longing. Should I\\nnot do her more grievous wrong in marrying her while I loved another\\nwoman?--I had been mad. I was appalled.\\n\\nCould I ever be at peace with her--ever make her happy? Fiesole was so\\nflippant, so casual of all that makes for wifehood. And she was almost\\nright in saying that I had made her what she was--first by my virtue,\\nnow by my lack of it. All we could give one another would be passion,\\nswift and self-consuming. Soon would come satiety, the fruit of my\\ndoings; after that regret, the fruit of my thoughts. And if we did not\\nmarry, I should eat the same fruit, made more bitter by self-scorn.\\n\\nMarry Fiesole! In marriage lay escape from the penalty of my lifelong\\nlawless curiosity. Walls of children might grow up, responsibilities of\\ndomestic affection, giving shelter and security.\\n\\nThis was treachery. Fiesole should never guess I had faltered. The door\\nshould be closed on the past----\\n\\nI had been waiting for, perhaps, half-an-hour, when I heard the chugging\\nof a motor newly started. There were no other travelers staying at the\\ninn; I thought that I recognized the beat of the engine. As I listened,\\nI felt sure that the car was being backed into the road. I expected to\\nhear it stop, and to see Fiesole come from under the archway and signal\\nfor me. It did not stop. It began to gather speed. The sound droned\\nfainter and fainter.\\n\\nPromise or no promise, I could not resist my excited curiosity. I ran\\nacross the orchard, through the courtyard, into the sunlit street. Far\\nup the road, I saw a cloud of dust growing smaller, disappearing in the\\ndirection of Paris. I watched, confused and dumbfounded, as it dwindled.\\n\\nThe old proprietress approached me shyly and touched me on the arm. “For\\nMonsieur from Madame.”\\n\\nSnatching the note from her hand, I tore it open with trembling fingers.\\nThe writing was hasty and agitated. I read and re-read it, trying to\\ntwist its words into another meaning.\\n\\nThe note ran:\\n\\n_My poor Dante, as you said to me, I have a woman’s memory; you’ll\\nremember Potiphar’s wife and Joseph. I have tried to hate you intensely.\\nYou see, I’m what you made me: Lucrezia--your handiwork. For years I\\nhave promised myself that, if ever I had the chance, I would punish you.\\nIt was with this intention that I left Paris yesterday--you know the\\nrest. So now, without me in the years that are to come, you will suffer\\nall that you once made me suffer. And I’m almost sorry; for here, at\\nFalaise, you nearly made me.... It can’t be done._\\n\\nRaising my eyes, I stood alone, gazing along the gleaming road to Paris.\\nThe cloud of dust had vanished.\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Garden Without Walls, by Coningsby Dawson\\n\\n*** \"}\n",

Image Credit: JPL/Space Science Institute.\\nby Henry Bortman\\nMoffett Field CA (SPX) Nov 01, 2004\\nWith only limited data, and a lot of imagination, scientists have constructed a provocative model of Saturn\\'s moon Titan. The giant moon, they say, is a prebiotic laboratory of sorts, with an atmosphere rich in methane and other organic compounds.\\nDown on the moon\\'s frozen surface, they suspect, are pools, lakes, perhaps even oceans of liquid hydrocarbons. One of the primary scientific goals of the Cassini-Huygens mission is to search for these bodies of liquid. Cassini\\'s initial results, however, are inconclusive.\\nCassini flew within 1200 kilometers (746 miles of Titan on Tuesday and collected a variety of data. Those most relevant to the liquid hydrocarbon question were captured by the spacecraft\\'s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) cameras and its RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) instrument.\\nTitan, unlike other moons in the solar system, is covered by a thick layer of haze, 1.5 times as dense as Earth\\'s atmosphere. This haze is composed mainly of nitrogen, but it also contains methane and other organic compounds. It\\'s like a big smog blanket lain over the entire world.\\nAs a result, images taken of the moon in visible light (the wavelengths of light that humans can see) show little more than a big fuzz ball. At these wavelengths, light from the surface can\\'t penetrate the haze. But at some infrared wavelengths, it can.\\nCassini\\'s cameras are designed to see not only the wavelengths that human eyes can see, but other wavelengths of light as well. The images sent back by Cassini from its first close flyby of Titan offer a view of the planet in near-infrared light, light with slightly longer wavelengths than what we can see.\\nWe can get a sense of what the world looks like in infrared by putting an infrared filter on a camera. The filter blocks visible light but lets infrared light through. This is precisely what the Cassini camera does: it places an infrared filter in front of its lens and then captures an image.\\nThe filter allowed Cassini\\'s camera to see Titan\\'s surface, but that was only the first step in the hunt for surface liquid. To increase the camera\\'s chance of detecting liquid pools, Cassini was aimed on a course that would maximize its chances of catching the glare of the sun\\'s reflection off any surface liquid that might be there.\\nPerhaps you\\'ve had the experience of seeing the sun dazzlingly reflected off the surface of the ocean, or a mountain lake. That same effect, known as \"specular reflection,\" is what Cassini\\'s cameras were looking for.\\nHad Cassini found liquid on Titan\\'s surface, it would have been like hitting a home run its first time at bat. But, says Caroline Porco, who heads Cassini\\'s imaging team, \"We have not seen a specular reflection yet in any of our data.\"\\nThat doesn\\'t mean there\\'s no liquid anywhere on the surface. Cassini was only able to look for specular reflections on a \"thin little region\" of the planet on its first close Titan flyby. As for the rest of the moon\\'s surface, \"we can\\'t say one way or the other. I think the jury is still out whether or not there\\'s any fluids on the surface of Titan,\" Porco says.\\nCassini also used a second instrument, its RADAR system, to look for evidence of liquid. Cassini\\'s RADAR can operate in several different modes. One of these modes produces images of the surface.\\nRADAR images aren\\'t like the pictures captured by the ISS camera; they\\'re not images of the light radiating out from the surface. Rather, the RADAR system shines its own light on Titan, using a microwave antenna as its light source. It beams microwave pulses at the surface, and then measures the strength of the signal reflected back to the spacecraft.\\nWhere there is a very strong reflection, the image gets a white pixel; where there\\'s no reflection at all, the image is black; various shades of gray represent intermediate signal strengths.\\nSounds simple enough. Until you realize that multiple factors can affect the strength of the reflection at a particular point. One factor is slope. If the surface that catches the microwave beam is sloped toward the spacecraft, a strong signal comes back. If it\\'s pointed away, nothing. Roughness also matters.\\nRough surfaces scatter the microwaves, reducing the reflection somewhat. But a completely smooth horizontal surface (a body of liquid, for example) reflects all the light away in the opposite direction, so it appears black in the resulting image.\\nThe third factor depends on the composition of the surface material. Rocks produce a relatively strong reflection. Organic goo - and scientists expect to find lots of organic goo on Titan - produces a relatively weak reflection.\\n\"It\\'s a combination of these three factors, the slope, the roughness or smoothness of the surface, and the property of that surface, that we need to untangle, to be able to determine what that surface is really made of,\" says Greg Elachi, Director of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and team leader for Cassini\\'s RADAR instrument. Sorting out these factors is not a task that is done easily or quickly. The initial results are hopeful, though.\\nIn the images produced by Cassini\\'s RADAR system, there are some regions that are very dark. One area about the size of Lake Tahoe is particularly promising. It could be just what scientists are looking for: a hydrocarbon lake. Then again, it might just be heavily coated with goo. Or slanted in the wrong direction.\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that the RADAR imaging technique won\\'t always reveal bodies of liquid, even if they\\'re there. It depends on the weather. If it\\'s a very windy day on Titan, the winds will kick up a lot of waves.\\nOtherwise glassy-smooth liquid surfaces will be rough and choppy. The RADAR system will see gray instead of black. So Cassini could fly right over a lake, image it with RADAR, and never even know it\\'s there.\\nThe take-home message from the initial RADAR results is what has become a mantra of sorts for the Cassini science team: \"We don\\'t have answers yet. It\\'s going to take a while.\"\\nFor one thing, the area imaged by Cassini\\'s RADAR during its first close flyby of Titan is only about 1 percent of the moon\\'s surface. Fox News might be willing to call an election with only 1 percent of the vote counted, but planetary scientists tend to proceed with a bit more caution.\\nIn addition, Cassini can\\'t do RADAR imaging and take ISS visible and infrared images of the same region of the moon\\'s surface during the same flyby. The instruments are on different sides of the spacecraft; they can\\'t be operated simultaneously. So there is no overlap between the ISS and RADAR data acquired to date.\\nWhen scientists have both types of data for the same area (along with other types of data that Cassini can acquire), they\\'ll be in a much stronger position to pull together a comprehensive interpretation.\\nSo is the surface of Titan dotted with hydrocarbon lakes? Perhaps the question is best answered by the inscrutable message from Mattel\\'s Magic 8-ball: Hazy now. Try again later.\\nCassini-Huygens at NASA\\nSpaceDaily\\nSearch SpaceDaily\\nSubscribe To SpaceDaily Express\\nCassini Peeks Below Cloud Shroud Around Titan\\nPasadena CA (JPL) Oct 29, 2004\\nEarly analysis of images and other data captured during last night\\'s close flyby of Saturn\\'s moon Titan by the Cassini spacecraft reveals greater surface detail than ever before and shows that Titan has lost much of its original atmosphere over time.'}\n",

The only worked solutions I can find are pretty unhelpful, as they are just for the Fourier sine and cosine transformations of the number 1, which largely translates into finding the integral of sin(ωt) or cos(ωt).\\nShould I use frequency shifting?\\nThe fourier transform of f(t)cos(ωsub0t) being equal to 0.5(F(ω-ωsub0) + F(ω+ωsub0))\\nand the fourier transform of exp(-5t) being 1 / (5 + iω)\\nis the Fourier Transformation of exp(-5t)cos(ωsub0t) equal to 1 / (5 + iωsub0)?\\nIn that case the simple, final answer provided would be wrong.\\ndifficult said: ↑\\nTake, for example, your first term.

Sine and cosine aren't functions of |exp(iωt)|.\\nThanks again. Going off on a tangent for a moment, do exp(iωt) and exp(-iωt) each form a circle of unit radius on an argand diagram?\\nWhen I substituted the number 1 for |exp(iωt)| and again the number 1 for |exp(-iωt)|, I\\nended up with Fc(ω) =(√(2/∏)) x (5 / (5squared PLUS ωsquared))\\nApparently it should actually be Fc(ω) =(√(2/∏)) x (5 / (5squared TIMES ωsquared))\\nWhen I substituted the number 1 for |exp(iωt)| and again the number 1 for |exp(-iωt)|, I ended up with Fc(ω) =(√(2/∏)) x (5 / (5squared PLUS ωsquared))\\nThe plus sign is correct. Another way you can look at the integral\\n$$\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-5t}\\\\cos\\\\omega t\\\\,dt = \\\\left.\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}\\\\cos\\\\omega t\\\\,dt\\\\right|_{s=5}$$ is as the Laplace transform of cos ωt evaluated when s=5. If you look up the Laplace transform for cosine in a table, you'll see there's supposed to be a plus there.\\nDoes |exp(-iωt)| = 1 aswell?\\nWhat does Euler's formula tell you?\\nHow should I manipulate Euler's formula ?\\nIncorporated this post in the next one...\\nSimilar Discussions: Fourier sine and cosine tranformation, difficult problem, (for me)\\nHalf range fourier cosine series (Replies: 1)\\nFourier Tranform of electric dipole charge density (Replies: 2)\\nHeat equation, Fourier cosine transform (Replies: 29)\\nSumming cosines of sines and cosines (Replies: 1)\\nDifficult Gravitational Force problem (Replies: 7)\"}\n",

A vertex with degree one is called a \\\\textit{pendant vertex}. The distance between the vertices $u$ and $v$ in graph $G$ is denoted by $d_G(u,v)$. A cycle $C$ is called \\\\textit{chordless} if $C$ has no \\\\textit{cycle chord} (that is an edge not in the edge set of $C$ whose endpoints lie on the vertices of $C$).\\nThe \\\\textit{Induced subgraph} on vertex set $S$ is denoted by $\\\\langle S\\\\rangle$. A path that starts in $v$ and ends in $u$ is denoted by $\\\\stackrel\\\\frown{v u}$.\\nA \\\\textit{traceable} graph is a graph that possesses a Hamiltonian path.\\nIn a graph $G$, we say that a cycle $C$ is \\\\textit{formed by the path} $Q$ if $ | E(C) \\\\setminus E(Q) | = 1 $. So every vertex of $C$ belongs to $V(Q)$.\\n\\nIn 2011 the following conjecture was proposed:\\n\\\\begin{conjecture}(Hoffmann-Ostenhof \\\\cite{hoffman})\\nLet $G$ be a connected cubic graph.

There are a few partial results known for Conjecture \\\\theconjecture. Kostochka \\\\cite{kostocha} noticed that the Petersen graph, the prisms over cycles, and many other graphs have a decomposition desired in Conjecture \\\\theconjecture. Ozeki and Ye \\\\cite{ozeki} proved that the conjecture holds for 3-connected cubic plane graphs. Furthermore, it was proved by Bachstein \\\\cite{bachstein} that Conjecture \\\\theconjecture$\\\\,$ is true for every 3-connected cubic graph embedded in torus or Klein-bottle. Akbari, Jensen and Siggers \\\\cite[Theorem 9]{akbari} showed that Conjecture \\\\theconjecture$\\\\,$ is true for Hamiltonian cubic graphs.\\n\\nIn this paper, we show that Conjecture \\\\theconjecture$\\\\,$ holds for traceable cubic graphs.\\n\\\\section{Results}\\nBefore proving the main result, we need the following lemma.\\n\\\\begin{lemma}\\n\\\\label{lemma:1}\\nLet $G$ be a cubic graph. Suppose that $V(G)$ can be partitioned into a tree $T$ and finitely many cycles such that there is no edge between any pair of cycles (not necessarily distinct cycles), and every pendant vertex of $T$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of a cycle. Then, Conjecture \\\\theconjecture$\\\\,$ holds for $G$.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nBy assumption, every vertex of each cycle in the partition is adjacent to exactly one vertex of $T$. Call the set of all edges with one endpoint in a cycle and another endpoint in $T$ by $Q$.\\nClearly, the induced subgraph on $E(T) \\\\cup Q$ is a spanning tree of $G$. We call it $T'$. Note that every edge between a pendant vertex of $T$ and the union of cycles in the partition is also contained in $T'$. Thus, every pendant vertex of $T'$ is contained in a cycle of the partition. Now, consider the graph $H = G \\\\setminus E(T')$. For every $v \\\\in V(T)$, $d_H(v) \\\\leq 1$.

This is a form and effort of Ruangguru in responding to the high need for distance learning facilities (PJJ) during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nPreviously, since March 2020 when learning activities from home were implemented due to Covid-19, Ruangguru has launched the free Ruangguru Online School.\\nIn the past school year, the Ruangguru Online School received a positive response with more than 5,000,000 students using it. More than 100,000 teachers have also participated in free online teacher training provided on the Ruangguru app.\\nThe enthusiasm of the teachers and students to continue learning inspires us to re-open the Ruangguru Free Online School, “explained Ruangguru’s founder and Chief Director, Belva Devara, as quoted from his official statement on Monday (3/8/2020).\\nRuangguru Online School 2 for Free\\nThrough the Ruangguru 2 Online School progra.\"\\n\\nWrite an extensive and detailed course unit in a textbook for college students related to the extract above, focusing on \"Social Studies Integration\" as part of \"EDUCATION / Schools / Levels / Elementary\".

Write the content directly.', 'text': \" In today's ever-evolving world, technology has become an integral part of our lives, shaping the way we learn, work, and communicate. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend, forcing educational institutions worldwide to adapt quickly to remote learning models. As such, social studies integration in elementary education can greatly benefit from incorporating digital tools like those offered by Ruangguru's Online School. Let's explore how educators can effectively leverage these resources to create engaging and meaningful learning experiences for young students.\\n\\nFirstly, let's define what we mean by social studies integration. Social studies encompasses various disciplines that help students understand their communities, societies, and the wider world around them. These subjects may include history, geography, civics, economics, sociology, and anthropology. By integrating social studies into the curriculum, we aim to foster critical thinking skills, promote cultural awareness, and encourage responsible citizenship among students. Now, let's see how Ruangguru's Online School supports these goals.\\n\\nRuangguru's Online School offers a wealth of opportunities for elementary students to engage with social studies topics in a dynamic and interactive manner. For instance, instead of simply reading about historical events or figures, students can participate in virtual simulations where they assume roles within specific time periods or cultures. Such immersive experiences allow children to connect emotionally with the material while developing essential collaboration and problem-solving abilities.\\n\\nAnother significant advantage of utilizing Ruangguru's platform is accessibility. With many schools closed due to the ongoing health crisis, ensuring continuity of learning has become paramount. Through Ruangguru's mobile application, students can access quality instructional materials anytime, anywhere—an especially crucial feature for families without reliable internet connections at home. Moreover, the platform allows teachers to track student progress, enabling them to provide targeted support and intervention when necessary.\\n\\nFurthermore, Ruangguru recognizes the importance of professional development for educators transitioning to remote teaching environments. To facilitate this process, they offer complimentary online teacher training sessions via their app. During these workshops, instructors can share best practices, discuss challenges, and collaborate on innovative strategies for delivering effective social studies lessons in a virtual setting. Additionally, connecting with fellow professionals fosters a sense of community among teachers, helping them feel supported and valued during uncertain times.\\n\\nMoreover, Ruangguru's Online School aligns seamlessly with current trends emphasizing project-based learning (PBL), which encourages students to apply knowledge and skills to solve authentic problems. For example, students might research local environmental issues, analyze data, and propose solutions using multimedia presentations created within the app. PBL approaches not only deepen conceptual understanding but also empower students to take action and contribute positively to their communities.\\n\\nLastly, Ruangguru's commitment to providing equitable access to quality education resonates strongly with recent calls for social justice reform in education. By offering free resources and training, they democratize learning opportunities, allowing all students to thrive regardless of socioeconomic background. Furthermore, incorporating diverse perspectives and histories into social studies curricula promotes inclusivity and empathy, preparing future generations to navigate an increasingly interconnected global society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, harnessing the power of digital platforms like Ruangguru's Online School can significantly enhance social studies integration efforts at the elementary level. Amidst unprecedented challenges brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic, embracing innovation becomes vital in creating resilient learners who are well-equipped to tackle complex issues facing our world today. Together, let us strive towards cultivating engaged, informed, and compassionate citizens ready to make a difference in their communities and beyond.\", 'token_length': 805, 'audience': 'college_students', 'format': 'textbook', 'seed_data': 'fineweb'}\n",

The key idea is then that we can use the cutoff $$\\\\lambda$$ instead of $$\\\\Lambda$$ if we include counter terms $$\\\\delta L(\\\\lambda,\\\\Lambda)$$. In particular, we end up with a renormalized effective Lagrangian $$L_R = L + \\\\delta L(\\\\lambda,\\\\Lambda) ,$$ which is valid up to the scale $$\\\\lambda$$. One way to understand this effective Lagrangian is by defining new parameters $$g_R, m_R$$ that are scale dependent. Specifically, we have $$g_R (\\\\lambda) := g +\\\\frac{g^2}{12 \\\\pi^2} \\\\ln(\\\\lambda /\\\\Lambda)$$, where $$g$$ is the \"bare\" coupling that appears in the original Lagrangian which is valid for cutoff $$\\\\Lambda$$.\\n\\nIt is then usually argued (see, for example, page 84 here) that this implies that if we measure $$g_R$$ at some scale $$\\\\mu_0$$, we can predict its value at any other scale $$\\\\mu$$ by using the analogous evolution equation $$g_R (\\\\mu) = g(\\\\mu_0) +\\\\frac{g(\\\\mu_0)^2}{12 \\\\pi^2} \\\\ln(\\\\mu /\\\\mu_0)$$\\n\\nThis seems to make sense at first glance, but raises many questions upon closer inspection. So how can this actually be derived? My main issue is that the scales $$\\\\mu$$ and $$\\\\mu_0$$ are physical scales relevant to the energy in a given process, whereas $$\\\\lambda$$ and $$\\\\Lambda$$ are cutoffs. Moreover, $$g$$ has no scale dependence. It\\'s the charge that appears in the original Lagrangian $$L$$ which is valid up to the cutoff scale $$\\\\Lambda$$. But there is no reason why this $$g$$ should depend on the energy scale in a given process.\\n\\n• The coupling $g$ is energy scale independent at the tree/classical level. Taking into account the quantum/loop/renormalization corrections, $g$ is inevitably incoming-momentum/energy dependent for a particle-particle scattering process. –\\xa0MadMax Jul 8 at 15:31'}\n",

However, distance does not seem to affect the arrival delay for both delayed and ontime flights. The scatter plots look almost uniform, meaning that distance is no real indication of an arrival delay. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also see by comparing the two scatterplots that departure delay tends to affect arrival delay as a majority of the flights either arrive ontime or much later. It is much rarer to see a flight arrive early given it has been delayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will calculate the bayesian probability below to put numerical backing to our claims from the graphs. \\r\\n\\r\\n```{r}\\r\\n#Probability a flight arrives early given it has been delayed\\r\\n#probability early and delayed / probability delayed\\r\\nearly.and.delayed = nrow(delayed[delayed$ArrDelay<0,])/nrow(abia)\\r\\nprob.delayed = nrow(delayed)/nrow(abia)\\r\\nearly.given.delayed = early.and.delayed/prob.delayed\\r\\n\\r\\n#Probability a flight arrives early given it is ontime\\r\\n#probability early and on time / probability ontime\\r\\nearly.and.ontime = nrow(on.time[on.time$ArrDelay<0, ])/nrow(abia)\\r\\nprob.ontime = nrow(on.time)/nrow(abia)\\r\\nearly.given.ontime = early.and.ontime/prob.ontime\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n* The probability of arriving early given your flight was delayed is: `r early.given.delayed`\\r\\n* The proability of arriving early given your flight was ontime is: `r early.given.ontime`\\r\\n\\r\\nThis makes logical sense, as it is more difficult to arrive early if you departed late. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at how departure delay affects arrival delay:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r}\\r\\n#mean arrival delay for delayed flights\\r\\n\\r\\narrival.delay = delayed$ArrDelay\\r\\n#omitting NA values\\r\\ndelay.arrival = na.omit(arrival.delay)\\r\\naverage.arrival.delay = mean(delay.arrival)\\r\\n\\r\\n#For comparison - what is the mean arrival delay for ontime flights\\r\\nontime.arrival = on.time$ArrDelay\\r\\n#omitting NA values\\r\\non.timearrival = na.omit(ontime.arrival)\\r\\naverage.ontime.arrival = mean(on.timearrival)\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n* The average arrival delay in minutes of delayed flights are: `r average.arrival.delay`\\r\\n* The average arrival delay in minutes of ontime flights are: `r average.ontime.arrival`\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now that we know the average arrival delay of a delayed flight, can we discern the typical arrival delay if we know how delayed a flight is?\\r\\n```{r}\\r\\n#Plot of departure delay and arrival delay\\r\\nthe.plot = plot(delayed$DepDelay, delayed$ArrDelay, xlab =\\'Departure Delay in minutes\\', ylab = \\'Arrival Delay in minutes\\', main = \\'Delayed Flights: Departure Delay vs. Arrival Delay\\')\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the scatter plot above we can see a positive correlation between departure delay and arrival delay.

      " In today's ever-evolving world, technology has become an integral part of our lives, shaping the way we learn, work, and communicate. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend, forcing educational institutions worldwide to adapt quickly to remote learning models. As such, social studies integration in elementary education can greatly benefit from incorporating digital tools like those offered by Ruangguru's Online School. Let's explore how educators can effectively leverage these resources to create engaging and meaningful learning experiences for young students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, let's define what we mean by social studies integration. Social studies encompasses various disciplines that help students understand their communities, societies, and the wider world around them. These subjects may include history, geography, civics, economics, sociology, and anthropology. By integrating social studies into the curriculum, we aim to foster critical thinking skills, promote cultural awareness, and encourage responsible citizenship among students. Now, let's see how Ruangguru's Online School supports these goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruangguru's Online School offers a wealth of opportunities for elementary students to engage with social studies topics in a dynamic and interactive manner. For instance, instead of simply reading about historical events or figures, students can participate in virtual simulations where they assume roles within specific time periods or cultures. Such immersive experiences allow children to connect emotionally with the material while developing essential collaboration and problem-solving abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another significant advantage of utilizing Ruangguru's platform is accessibility. With many schools closed due to the ongoing health crisis, ensuring continuity of learning has become paramount. Through Ruangguru's mobile application, students can access quality instructional materials anytime, anywhere—an especially crucial feature for families without reliable internet connections at home. Moreover, the platform allows teachers to track student progress, enabling them to provide targeted support and intervention when necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Ruangguru recognizes the importance of professional development for educators transitioning to remote teaching environments. To facilitate this process, they offer complimentary online teacher training sessions via their app. During these workshops, instructors can share best practices, discuss challenges, and collaborate on innovative strategies for delivering effective social studies lessons in a virtual setting. Additionally, connecting with fellow professionals fosters a sense of community among teachers, helping them feel supported and valued during uncertain times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Ruangguru's Online School aligns seamlessly with current trends emphasizing project-based learning (PBL), which encourages students to apply knowledge and skills to solve authentic problems. For example, students might research local environmental issues, analyze data, and propose solutions using multimedia presentations created within the app. PBL approaches not only deepen conceptual understanding but also empower students to take action and contribute positively to their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Ruangguru's commitment to providing equitable access to quality education resonates strongly with recent calls for social justice reform in education. By offering free resources and training, they democratize learning opportunities, allowing all students to thrive regardless of socioeconomic background. Furthermore, incorporating diverse perspectives and histories into social studies curricula promotes inclusivity and empathy, preparing future generations to navigate an increasingly interconnected global society.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, harnessing the power of digital platforms like Ruangguru's Online School can significantly enhance social studies integration efforts at the elementary level. Amidst unprecedented challenges brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic, embracing innovation becomes vital in creating resilient learners who are well-equipped to tackle complex issues facing our world today. Together, let us strive towards cultivating engaged, informed, and compassionate citizens ready to make a difference in their communities and beyond.\n",
      "Here is an extract from a webpage:\n",
      "\"Ruangguru Free Online Schools to Support Students and Teachers\n",
